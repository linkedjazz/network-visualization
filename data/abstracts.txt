<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chuck_Andrus> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Chuck Andrus (November 17, 1928 \u2013 October 10, 1997) was an American jazz double-bassist. Andrus was raised in New England and studied at the Manhattan School of Music. In the late 1940s he formed his own ensemble in Springfield, Massachusetts which included Sal Salvador and Phil Woods. He played with Charlie Barnet in 1953, then with Claude Thornhill through the middle of the decade. While with Thornhill he met Terry Gibbs, and the two frequently played and recorded together in subsequent years. As a freelance musician in New York, Andrus worked with Don Stratton, Bernard Peiffer, and Jim Chapin; he also recorded extensively with Woody Herman. One of the most surprising moments of his life came when he went to see a new movie that he hadn't heard about. It was The Wrong Man, a true story starring Henry Fonda. The movie opened with the protagonist, a bass player, leaving his gig late at night at the Stork Club with his double-bass in tow. He then walked down the dark streets to the subway, rode out to Queens, then walked to his apartment. The reason this freaked Chuck out was that he had just recently started at the Stork Cub, replacing the guy who he later discovered had replaced the Wrong Man. Not only that, but Chuck took the same subway every night he worked, to the same stop in Queens, and remarkably, walked by the same block where the other bassist had lived."@en .

Dean was born Nottingham, England, moving to Tooting, London, soon after his birth. From 1966\u201367, Dean was a member of the band Bluesology, led by Long John Baldry. The band's pianist, Reginald Dwight, afterward combined Dean's and Baldry's first names for his own stage name, Elton John. Dean established his reputation as a member of the Keith Tippett Sextet from 1968 to 1970, and in the band Soft Machine from 1969 to 1972. Shortly before leaving Soft Machine he started his own group, Just Us. From 1975 to 1978 he led a nine-piece band called Ninesense, performing at the Bracknell Jazz Festival and similar events. His own groups since then, usually quartets or quintets, have most often worked in the free jazz mode, with little or no pre-composed material. At the same time, he continued to work with other groups that are very composition-based, such as guitarist Phil Miller's In Cahoots, drummer Pip Pyle's Equipe Out, and various projects with former Soft Machine bassist Hugh Hopper. In 2002, Dean and three other former Soft Machine members toured and recorded under the name Soft Works. With another former Soft Machine member, guitarist John Etheridge, replacing Holdsworth, they subsequently toured and recorded as Soft Machine Legacy, playing some pieces from the original Soft Machine repertoire as well as new works. Featuring Dean, three albums of theirs have been released: Live in Zaandam (CD, rec. 2005/05/10), New Morning - The Paris Concert (DVD, rec. 2005/12/12) and the studio album Soft Machine Legacy (CD, 2006, rec. 2005). Dean's last musical collaborations also included those with Soft Bounds (a quartet composed of Dean, Hugh Hopper, Sophia Domancich and Simon Goubert) and Alex Maguire's project Psychic Warrior."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bob_Dylan> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Bob Dylan is an American musician, singer-songwriter, record producer, artist, poet, and writer. He has been an influential figure in popular music and culture for more than five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s when he was an informal chronicler and a seemingly reluctant figurehead of social unrest. A number of Dylan's early songs, such as \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\", became anthems for the US civil rights and anti-war movements. Leaving his initial base in the culture of folk music behind, Dylan's six-minute single \"Like a Rolling Stone\" radically altered the parameters of popular music in 1965. His recordings employing electric instruments attracted denunciation and criticism from others in the folk movement. Dylan's lyrics have incorporated a variety of political, social, philosophical, biblical, and literary influences. They defied existing pop music conventions and appealed hugely to the then burgeoning counterculture. Initially inspired by the performance style of Little Richard, and the songwriting of Woody Guthrie, Robert Johnson, and Hank Williams, Dylan has both amplified and personalized musical genres. His recording career, spanning fifty years, has explored many of the traditions in American song\u2014from folk, blues, and country to gospel, rock and roll, and rockabilly to English, Scottish, and Irish folk music, embracing even jazz and swing. Dylan performs with guitar, keyboards, and harmonica. Backed by a changing line-up of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the Never Ending Tour. His accomplishments as a recording artist and performer have been central to his career, but his greatest contribution is generally considered to be his songwriting. Since 1994, Dylan has published three books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries. As a songwriter and musician, Dylan has sold more than 100 million records worldwide and received numerous awards over the years including Grammy, Golden Globe, and Academy Awards; he has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Minnesota Music Hall of Fame, Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, and Songwriters Hall of Fame. The Pulitzer Prize jury in 2008 awarded him a special citation for \"his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power. \" In May 2012, Dylan received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama."@en .

He was also the author of instructional books that explored his approach to guitar-based harmony. He was well known as a pioneer of the seven-string guitar, which allowed him to incorporate sophisticated bass lines into his improvisation. He was a strong influence on later seven-string players such as Howard Alden (with whom he recorded four CDs for Concord Records in the early 1990s), Bucky Pizzarelli, and John Pizzarelli (Bucky's son).

He was the nephew of John Robichaux. Joe Robichaux played piano from a young age and studied at New Orleans University. After working in the O.J. Beatty Carnival, he played with Tig Chambers briefly in 1918. He then returned to New Orleans and played with Oscar Celestin, Earl Humphrey, Lee Collins, and The Black Eagles (1922-23). He arranged for the Jones-Collins Astoria Hot Eight in 1929 and also recorded with them; he also accompanied Christina Gray on record that year. In 1931 he formed his own ensemble, which featured Eugene Ware on trumpet, Alfred Guichard on clarinet and alto saxophone, Gene Porter on tenor sax, and Ward Crosby on drums; they went to New York City to record for Vocalion in August 1933, laying down 22 stomping, uptempo sides and two alternate takes in a marathon 5 day recording schedule. Problems with the musicians' union in New York prevented them from being able to play live there, and they returned to New Orleans not long after recording. Robichaux expanded the size of his ensemble over the course of the 1930s; Earl Bostic was among those who joined its ranks. They toured Cuba in the mid-1930s and also recorded for Decca Records in 1936, which unfortunately were rejected. In 1939 Robichaux's ensemble disbanded, and he found work performing solo, mostly in New Orleans. He recorded as an accompanist on R&B recordings in the 1950s, and played with Lizzie Miles. Late in his life he played with George Lewis (1957-64) and Peter Bocage (1962); he also performed at Preservation Hall. He died of a heart attack at the age of 64 in 1965."@en .

Fellow saxophonist Lester Young, who was called \"Pres\", in a 1959 interview with The Jazz Review, said: \"As far as I'm concerned, I think Coleman Hawkins was the President first, right?

Coming to prominence in the 1920s as an \"inventive\" trumpet and cornet player, Armstrong was a foundational influence in jazz, shifting the focus of the music from collective improvisation to solo performance. With his instantly-recognizable gravelly voice, Armstrong was also an influential singer, demonstrating great dexterity as an improviser, bending the lyrics and melody of a song for expressive purposes. He was also skilled at scat singing (vocalizing using sounds and syllables instead of actual lyrics). Renowned for his charismatic stage presence and voice almost as much as for his trumpet-playing, Armstrong's influence extends well beyond jazz music, and by the end of his career in the 1960s, he was widely regarded as a profound influence on popular music in general. Armstrong was one of the first truly popular African-American entertainers to \"cross over\", whose skin-color was secondary to his music in an America that was severely racially divided. He rarely publicly politicized his race, often to the dismay of fellow African-Americans, but took a well-publicized stand for desegregation during the Little Rock Crisis. His artistry and personality allowed him socially acceptable access to the upper echelons of American society that were highly restricted for a black man."@en .

He is one of the founding fathers of funk music and is a major figure of 20th century popular music and dance. In a career that spanned six decades, Brown profoundly influenced the development of many different musical genres. Brown moved on a continuum of blues and gospel-based forms and styles to a profoundly \"Africanized\" approach to music making. First coming to national public attention in the mid-1950s as a member of the R&B singing group The Famous Flames, Brown performed in concerts, first making his rounds across the chitlin' circuit, and then across the country and later around the world, along with appearing in shows on television and in movies. Although he contributed much to the music world through his hitmaking, Brown holds the record as the artist who charted the most singles on the Billboard Hot 100 without ever hitting number one on that chart. For many years, Brown's touring show was one of the most extravagant productions in American popular music. At the time of Brown's death, his band included three guitarists, two bass guitar players, two drummers, three horns and a percussionist. The bands that he maintained during the late 1960s and 1970s were of comparable size, and the bands also included a three-piece amplified string section that played during ballads. Brown employed between 40 and 50 people for the James Brown Revue, and members of the revue traveled with him in a bus to cities and towns all over the country, performing upwards of 330 shows a year with almost all of the shows as one-nighters. In 1986, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and in 2000 into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. He is ranked seventh on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time. \" Brown died on Christmas Day 2006 from heart failure after becoming very ill two days earlier and being hospitalized for hours.

She was a major Hollywood sex symbol of the 1950s and early 1960s. Mansfield was 20th Century Fox's alternative Marilyn Monroe and came to be known as the Working Man's Monroe. She was also known for her well-publicized personal life and publicity stunts. Mansfield became a major Broadway star in 1955, a major Hollywood star in 1956, and a leading celebrity in 1957. She was one of Hollywood's original blonde bombshells, and although many people have never seen her movies, Mansfield remains one of the most recognizable icons of 1950s celebrity culture. With the decrease of the demand for big-breasted blonde bombshells and the increase in the negative backlash against her over-publicity, she became a box-office has-been by the early 1960s. While Mansfield's film career was short-lived, she had several box office successes and won a Theatre World Award and a Golden Globe. She enjoyed success in the role of fictional actress Rita Marlowe in both the 1955\u20131956 Broadway version, and, in the 1957 Hollywood film version of Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?. She showcased her comedic skills in The Girl Can't Help It (1956), her dramatic assets in The Wayward Bus (1957), and her sizzling presence in Too Hot to Handle (1960). She also sang for studio recordings, including the album Shakespeare, Tchaikovsky & Me and the singles Suey and As the Clouds Drift by. Mansfield's notable television work included television dramas Follow the Sun and Burke's Law, game shows The Match Game and What's My Line?, variety shows The Jack Benny Program and The Bob Hope Show, the The Ed Sullivan Show, and a large number of talk shows. By the early 1960s, Mansfield's box office popularity had declined and Hollywood studios lost interest in her. Some of the last attempts that Hollywood took to publicize her were in The George Raft Story (1961) and It Happened in Athens (1962). But, towards the end of her career, Mansfield remained a popular celebrity, continuing to attract large crowds outside the United States and in lucrative and successful nightclub acts, and summer-theater work. Her film career continued with cheap independent films and European melodramas and comedies, with some of her later films being filmed in United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, and Greece. In the sexploitation film Promises! Promises! (1963), she became the first major American actress to have a nude starring role in a Hollywood motion picture. Mansfield took her professional name from her first husband, public relations professional Paul Mansfield, with whom she had a daughter. She was the mother of three children from her second marriage to actor\u2013bodybuilder Mickey Hargitay. She married her third husband, film director Matt Cimber in 1964, and separated from him in 1966. Mansfield and Cimber had a son. In 1967 Mansfield died in a car accident at the age of 34."@en .

King, is an American blues guitarist and singer-songwriter. Rolling Stone magazine ranked him at No. 6 on its list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time (previously ranked No. 3 in the 2003 edition of the same list), and he was ranked No. 17 in Gibson's Top 50 Guitarists of All Time. According to Edward M. Komara, King \"introduced a sophisticated style of soloing based on fluid string bending and shimmering vibrato that would influence virtually every electric blues guitarist that followed. \" King was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987. He is considered one of the most influential blues musicians of all time, earning the nickname 'The King of Blues', and one of the \"Three Kings of the Blues Guitar\". He is also known for performing tirelessly throughout his musical career appearing at 250-300 concerts per year until his seventies. In 1956 it was noted that he appeared at 342 shows, and still at the age of 87 King appears at 100 shows a year. Over the years, King has developed one of the world's most identifiable guitar styles. He borrowed from Blind Lemon Jefferson, T-Bone Walker and others, integrating his precise and complex vocal-like string bends and his left hand vibrato, both of which have become indispensable components of rock guitarists' vocabulary. His economy and phrasing has been a model for thousands of players, from Eric Clapton and George Harrison to Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck. King has mixed blues, jazz, swing, mainstream pop and jump into a unique sound. In King's words, \"When I sing, I play in my mind; the minute I stop singing orally, I start to sing by playing Lucille.\""@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joe_Marsala> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Joe Marsala (January 4, 1907 \u2013 March 4, 1978) was an Italian-American jazz clarinetist and songwriter, born and initially based in Chicago, Marsala moved to New York City in 1933 at the request of Wingy Manone. It was in NYC that Joe found his greatest success as the leader of the 1936 band that entered the Hickory House on 52nd Street. He remained there as leader for ten years. Primarily self-taught, Joe and his brother Marty(trumpet)hung out in the early 1920s behind the clubs on the south side of Chicago listening to and absorbing the music called jazz. He was active during the big band era though he preferred the smaller combos of six or seven in which each member could really swing. Marsala is notable as one of the early employers of drummers Buddy Rich and Shelley Manne, jazz harpist Adele Girard whom he later married,guitarist Charlie Byrd, pianist Gene DiNovi and trumpeter Neal Hefti. Other early band members were trumpeter brother Marty, pianist Joe Bushkin, guitarists Eddie Condon, Jack Lemaire, Carmen Mastren, and bassist Artie Shapiro. Jazz critic and pianistLeonard Feather, among others, gives him a good deal of credit for breaking down race segregation in jazz when he hired trumpeter Henry,\"Red\" Allen in 1936. In the early 1940s Marsala invited many fine African American musicians to sit in on his Sunday jam sessions at the Hickory House, trumpeter Clarence\"Hot Lips\"Page, saxophonist Coleman Hawkins, vibraphonist Lionel Hampton, drummer Zutty Singleton, and pianist Fats Waller were a few. Marsala's earliest friendships in Chicago from neighbors to the back alleys of the south side to his earliest recording sessions were peopled with African Americans whom he respected as the first and finest of jazz musicians. Hiring and inviting these musicians to display their talents with his band was just something that came naturally to Joe, it wasn't done for effect or to impress. Marsala's own playing was rich and graceful, owing a lot to one of his idols, Jimmie Noone. Benny Goodman once said that he \"would feel more like the king of swing if he had a lower register like Joe Marsala. \" In 1959 Louis Armstrong said of Joe that he was \"one of the finest clarinetists around. \" Although usually thought of as a \"dixielander\" along with Eddie Condon, Marsala was more adventurous: in the 1940s he used Dizzy Gillespie on a recording session, for instance. He also cut some very modern sounding sides with guitarist/composer Chuck Wayne. That said, he did have some difficulties adjusting to the bebop era; he simply preferred traditional and swing styles to the newer cool jazz. By 1949 he partly switched to writing songs in the genre now called classic pop. Among these songs was the hit Don't Cry, Joe (Let Her Go, Let Her Go, Let Her Go), recorded by Frank Sinatra in 1949. The song led friends to the unfounded fear his marriage to Adele Girard was over when in fact it was written for GIs returning from WW2 only to find that girlfriends had married other guys. He also wrote And So to Sleep Again with lyric help from Sonny Skylar and which was recorded by Patti Page in 1951. A friendship with Jack Gordon who worked for RCA Records led Joe to teaching Jack's son Bobby the finer points of the clarinet. Bobby became Joe's prot\u00E9g\u00E9 and Joe worked on Bobby's behalf to make him known by showing him the ropes in the jazz world, introducing him to well known musicians and producing his first records for Decca, \"Warm And Sentimental\" and \"Young Man's Fancy. \" Joe was particularly proud of his accomplishments as teacher, friend and mentor to Bobby Gordon. Gordon, for his part has played Marsala songs on a number of his recordings, most recently,\"Bobby Gordon Plays Joe Marsala, Lower Register\" for Arbors records in 2007, as well as featuring Marsala's wife Adele in her final session also for Arbors in 1992, \"The Bobby Gordon Quartet Featuring Adele Girard Marsala, Don't Let It End. \" According to his wife, Adele, in his early years Joe Marsala suffered from an allergy to nickel and had a constant irritating rash on his hands from contact with the nickel plated keys on the clarinet. He was also somewhat plagued by colitis and was unable to drink alcohol for a time; an operation in 1945 cured that condition. Though his younger brother Marty was drafted, Joe was an unacceptable candidate for WWII because of cartilage and ligament tears resulting in \"water on the knee. \" To make up for that Joe and Adele entertained stateside for the USO during the war years. A lifelong smoker, Joe died in Santa Barbara, California at age 71 of cancer. Joe Marsala was the brother of jazz musician Marty Marsala."@en .

He was born in Seattle, Washington. His mother was a violinist and his father a singer, and the family was in vaudeville, so he was early exposed to music. In 1933 he joined Horace Heidt's orchestra as a vocalist and pianist. Later on, he formed his own band, with Dick Haymes as vocalist. He became vocal coach, arranger, and accompanist for Martha Tilton, and worked with a new vocal group, the Stafford Sisters. Jo Stafford, one of the sisters, joined the Tommy Dorsey band in 1940 and persuaded Dorsey to hire Dennis as arranger and composer. Dennis wrote prolifically, with fourteen of his songs recorded by the Dorsey band in one year alone, including \"Everything Happens to Me,\" an early hit for Frank Sinatra. After three and a half years in the United States Air Force in World War II, Dennis returned to music writing and arranging, getting a boost from his old friend Dick Haymes, who hired him to be the music director for his radio program. With lyricist Tom Adair he wrote songs for Haymes' program. Dennis made six albums most of which are out of print; however his 1953 song \"Angel Eyes\" has become a frequently recorded jazz standard; less frequently recorded, but notably by Miles Davis and Sonny Rollins is \"Will You Still Be Mine\"."@en .

Described by Fred Astaire as \"the greatest entertainer who ever lived\" and renowned for her contralto voice, she attained international stardom throughout a career that spanned more than 40 years as an actress in musical and dramatic roles, as a recording artist and on the concert stage. Respected for her versatility, she received a Juvenile Academy Award and won a Golden Globe Award as well as Grammy Awards and a Special Tony Award. She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in the remake of A Star is Born and for the Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the 1961 film Judgment at Nuremberg. She remains the youngest recipient (at 39 years of age) of the Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement in the motion picture industry. After appearing in vaudeville with her two older sisters, Garland was signed to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer as a teenager. There she made more than two dozen films, including nine with Mickey Rooney and the 1939 film with which she would be most identified, The Wizard of Oz. After 15 years, she was released from the studio but gained renewed success through record-breaking concert appearances, including a return to acting beginning with critically acclaimed performances. Despite her professional triumphs, Garland struggled immensely in her personal life, starting when she was a child. Her self-image was strongly influenced by film executives, who said she was unattractive and constantly manipulated her onscreen physical appearance. She was plagued by financial instability, often owing hundreds of thousands of dollars in back taxes. She married five times, with her first four marriages ending in divorce. She also had a long battle with drugs and alcohol, which ultimately led to her death at the age of 47. In 1997, Garland was posthumously awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Several of her recordings have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In 1999, the American Film Institute placed her among the ten greatest female stars in the history of American cinema."@en .

Leader of one of the most popular dance bands in the United States during the 1920s, Whiteman produced recordings that were immensely successful, and press notices often referred to him as the \"King of Jazz\". Using a large ensemble and exploring many styles of music, Whiteman is perhaps best known for his blending of symphonic music and jazz, as typified by his 1924 commissioning and debut of George Gershwin's jazz-influenced \"Rhapsody In Blue\". Later, Whiteman's work on Symphonic Jazz influenced many jazz musicians either way - directly or indirectly - as diverse as Miles Davis, Gil Evans, the Modern Jazz Quartet, Winton Marsalis and other modern artists. Whiteman recorded many jazz and pop standards during his career, including \"Wang Wang Blues\", \"Mississippi Mud\", \"Rhapsody in Blue\", \"Wonderful One\", \"Hot Lips (He's Got Hot Lips When He Plays Jazz)\", \"Mississippi Suite\", and \"Grand Canyon Suite\". His popularity faded in the swing music era of the 1930s, and by the 1940s Whiteman was semi-retired from music. Whiteman's place in the history of early jazz is somewhat controversial. Detractors suggest that Whiteman's ornately-orchestrated music was jazz in name only (lacking the genre's improvisational and emotional depth), and co-opted the innovations of black musicians. Defenders note that Whiteman's fondness for jazz was genuine (he worked with black musicians as much as was feasible during an era of racial segregation), that his bands included many of the era's most esteemed white jazz musicians, and argue that Whiteman's groups handled jazz admirably as part of a larger repertoire. In his autobiography, Duke Ellington declared, \"Paul Whiteman was known as the King of Jazz, and no one as yet has come near carrying that title with more certainty and dignity.\""@en .

He was born in New Orleans. Nicholas began playing professionally on clarinet, and continued occasionally doubling on it in later years after he had mostly switched to cornet. Nicholas knew Buddy Bolden and said Bolden was the main influence on his cornet style, but did not begin playing cornet until he 1915 when he was playing clarinet with King Oliver and started playing around with Oliver's cornet while Oliver was on break. He lived nearly his entire life in New Orleans, and played in many brass bands and street ensembles in the city for decades, in addition to forming the Camelia Brass Band in 1918. He was famed for his volume and his endurance, though these are not evident on most of his recordings (a notable exception being his driving version of \"Shake It and Break It\", American Music Records MX 800). Nicholas did not record until 1945, when he was 62 years old, and by that time he was far past his prime. He recorded again in 1949 as a leader, in addition to playing with Raymond Burke. Nicholas died in New Orleans in November 1957. He was the uncle of clarinetist Albert Nicholas."@en .

At university, he was an outstanding American football player, then had an international career in singing, as well as acting in theater and cinema. He became politically involved in response to the Spanish Civil War, Fascism, and social injustices. His advocacy of anti-imperialism, affiliation with Communism, and his criticism of the US government caused him to be blacklisted during McCarthyism. Ill health forced him into retirement from his career. To the end he remained unapologetic for the unpopular political stances he took. Robeson won an academic scholarship to Rutgers University, where he became a football All-American and the class valedictorian. He attended Columbia Law School, while playing in the National Football League (NFL). At Columbia, he sang and acted in off-campus productions and post-graduate, he became a participant in the Harlem Renaissance with performances in The Emperor Jones and All God's Chillun Got Wings. Robeson initiated his international artistic r\u00E9sum\u00E9 with a theatrical role in Great Britain before settling in London for the next several years with his wife Essie. His portrayal of Othello in London has been considered the high point in English Shakespearean theatre in the 20th Century. While Robeson became an international cinematic star in roles in Show Boat, Bosambo, and Sanders of the River, he became increasingly attuned towards the sufferings of all cultures and peoples. Acting against advice, which foretold of his economic ruin if he became politically active, he relegated his theatrical career to advocate the cause of the Republican forces of the Spanish Civil War, and he then became active in the Council on African Affairs (CAA). During World War II, he supported America's war efforts and won accolades for his portrayal of Othello on Broadway. However, his history of supporting pro-Soviet policies brought scrutiny from the FBI. After the war ended, the CAA was placed on the Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations (AGLOSO) and he was investigated during the age of McCarthyism. Due to his decision not to recant his public advocacy of pro-Soviet policies, he was denied a passport by the U.S. State Department, and his income, consequently, plummeted. He moved to Harlem and published a periodical critical of US policies. His right to travel was eventually restored by Kent v. Dulles, but his health broke down. He retired and he lived out the remaining years of his life privately in Philadelphia."@en .

He is considered to be one of the greatest heavyweights of all time. Nicknamed the Brown Bomber, Louis helped elevate boxing from a nadir in popularity in the post-Jack Dempsey era by establishing a reputation as an honest, hardworking fighter at a time when the sport was dominated by gambling interests. Louis' championship reign lasted 140 consecutive months, during which he participated in 26 championship fights; a 27th fight, against Ezzard Charles, was a challenge to Charles' Heavyweight title and so is not included in Louis' reign. All in all, Joe was victorious in 25 successful title defenses, a record for the heavyweight division. In 2005, Louis was ranked as the #1 heavyweight of all-time by the International Boxing Research Organization, and was ranked #1 on The Ring's list of the 100 Greatest Punchers of All-Time. Louis' cultural impact was felt well outside the ring. He is widely regarded as the first African American to achieve the status of a nationwide hero within the United States, and was also a focal point of anti-Nazi sentiment leading up to and during World War II. He also was instrumental in integrating the game of golf, breaking the sport's color barrier in America by appearing under a sponsor's exemption in a PGA event in 1952. Detroit's Joe Louis Arena, home of the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League, and the Forest Preserve District of Cook County's Joe Louis \"The Champ\" Golf Course, situated south of Chicago in Riverdale, IL, are named in his honor."@en .

In 1956, he began to tour Europe and the Americas playing Indian classical music and increased its popularity there in the 1960s through teaching, performance, and his association with violinist Yehudi Menuhin and rock artist George Harrison of the Beatles. Shankar engaged Western music by writing concerti for sitar and orchestra and toured the world in the 1970s and 1980s. From 1986 to 1992 he served as a nominated member of Rajya Sabha, the upper chamber of the Parliament of India.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bennie_Moten> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Bennie Moten (November 13, 1894 \u2013 April 2, 1935) was a noted American jazz pianist and band leader born in Kansas City, Missouri. He led the Kansas City Orchestra, the most important of the regional, blues-based orchestras active in the Midwest in the 1920s, and helped to develop the riffing style that would come to define many of the 1930s Big Bands. His first recordings were made in 1923, and were rather typical interpretations of the New Orleans style of King Oliver and others. They also showed the influence of the Ragtime that was still popular in the area. These OKeh sides (recorded 1923-1925) are some of the more valuable acoustic jazz 78's of the era and continue to be treasured records in many serious jazz collections. They signed with Victor Records in 1926, and were influenced by the more sophisticated style of Fletcher Henderson, but more often than not featured a hard stomp beat that was extremely popular in Kansas City. Moten remained one of Victor's most popular orchestras through 1930. The song Kansas City Shuffle was recorded during this time. (The band recorded prolifically and many of their records were issued in Victor's regular series, therefore not specifically marketed to the Black community. ) By 1928 Moten's piano was showing some Boogie Woogie influences, but the real revolution came in 1929 when he recruited Count Basie, Walter Page and Oran 'Hot Lips' Page. Walter Page's walking bass lines gave the music an entirely new feel compared to the 2/4 tuba of his predecessor Vernon Page, coloured by Basie's understated, syncopated piano fills. Another boon to the band was adding Jimmy Rushing as their primary vocalist. Their final session (10 recordings made at Victor's Camden, NJ studios on December 13, 1932, during a time when the band was suffering significant financial hardship) showed the early stages of what became known as the \"Basie sound\"; four years before Basie would record under his own name. By this time Ben Webster and Jimmy Rushing had joined Moten's band, but Moten himself does not play on these sessions. These sides (mostly arranged by Eddie Durham) include a number of tunes that later became swing classics: \"Toby\" \"Moten Swing\" \"The Blue Room\" \"Imagination\" \"New Orleans\" \"The Only Girl I Ever Loved\" \"Milenberg Joys\" \"Lafayette\" \"Prince of Wails\" \"Two Times\" (recorded with six musicians and with vocalist Josephine Garrison) After Moten's death in 1935 after an unsuccessful tonsillectomy, Basie took many of the leading musicians from the band to form his own orchestra. Moten's popular 1928 recording of \"South\" (V-38021) stayed in Victor's catalog over the years (reissued as 24893 in 1935 as Victor phased out any remaining V-38000 series that were still in the catalog) and became a big jukebox hit in the late 1940s (by then, reissued as 44-0004). It remained in print (as a vinyl 45) until RCA stopping making vinyl records!"@en .

Nancy was born in New York City; her parents divorced soon after her birth and she grew up in Maryland, living with an aunt and uncle while her mother pursued acting jobs. As Nancy Davis, she was an actress in Hollywood in the 1940s and 1950s, starring in films such as Donovan's Brain, Night into Morning, and Hellcats of the Navy. In 1952 she married Ronald Reagan, who was then president of the Screen Actors Guild, and they had two children. Nancy was the First Lady of California when her husband was Governor from 1967 to 1975. In that capacity, she began work with the Foster Grandparents Program. Nancy Reagan became First Lady of the United States in January 1981 following her husband's election. She was criticized early in his first term largely due to her decision to replace the White House china, despite it being paid for by private donations. Nancy restored a Kennedy-esque glamor to the White House following years of lax formality, and her interest in high-end fashion garnered much attention, as well as criticism. She championed recreational drug prevention causes by founding the \"Just Say No\" drug awareness campaign, which was considered her major initiative as first lady. Always protective of her husband, more controversy ensued when it was revealed in 1988 that she had consulted an astrologer to assist in planning the president's schedule after the 1981 assassination attempt on her husband. She had a strong influence on her husband and played a role in a few of his personnel and diplomatic decisions. The Reagans retired to their home in Bel Air, Los Angeles, California in 1989. Nancy devoted most of her time to caring for her ailing husband, diagnosed in 1994 with Alzheimer's disease, until his death in 2004. Nancy Reagan has remained active within the Reagan Library and in politics, particularly in support of embryonic stem cell research."@en .

She was billed as The Mother of the Blues. She began performing at the age of 12 or 14, and recorded under the name Ma Rainey after she and Will Rainey were married in 1904. They toured with F.S. Wolcott\u2019s Rabbit Foot Minstrels and later formed their own group called Rainey and Rainey, Assassinators of the Blues. From the time of her first recording in 1923 to five years later, Ma Rainey made over 100 recordings. Some of them include, Bo-weevil Blues (1923), Moonshine Blues (1923), See See Rider (1924), Black Bottom (1927), and Soon This Morning (1927). Ma Rainey was known for her very powerful vocal abilities, energetic disposition, majestic phrasing, and a \u2018moaning\u2019 style of singing similar to folk tradition. Though her powerful voice and disposition are not captured on her recordings (due to her recording exclusively for Paramount, which was known for worse-than-normal recording techniques and among the industry's poorest shellac quality), the other characteristics are present, and most evident on her early recordings, Bo-weevil Blues and Moonshine Blues. Ma Rainey also recorded with Louis Armstrong in addition to touring and recording with the Georgia Jazz Band. Ma Rainey continued to tour until 1935 when she retired to her hometown."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leon_Mobley> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Leon Mobley is a percussionist and drummer, founder and artistic and musical director of Da Lion and Djimbe West African Drummers and Dancers and a member of The Innocent Criminals, Ben Harper's band. He is presently working with Damian Marley and Nas on the project called \"Distant Relatives\" Leon Mobley's natural talent and infectious smile have taken him a long way. From child actor on PBS Television show ZOOM (1973) to touring the globe as drummer / percussionist with Ben Harper and the Innocent Criminals (1993\u2013present), Leon's sheer exuberance and joie de vivre is ever present. Leon began playing African drums in 1967, studying for 10 years under the tutelage of seminal Nigerian master drummer Babatunde Olatunji at the Elma Lewis School of Fine Arts in Boston, Massachusetts. In 1977 Leon studied under the directorship of Senegalese master drummer Ibrahim Camara (former drummer for the National Ballet of Senegal) while a member of the Bokan-Deye Dance Company. Leon was building a name for himself as a drummer and became a much sought after player in the world of African music. A testament to his newfound status as a major player on the African music scene was when he was invited to South Africa in 1991 to perform with returning exiles Letta Mbulu, Caiphus Semenya, and Hugh Masekela, artists known worldwide as some of Africa's greatest musicians. One of the highlights of Leon's career was meeting and playing for Nelson Mandela when he was released from prison after 27 years as a political prisoner. Leon studied and performed from 1979 to 1981 in Surinam, South America, Trinidad - Tobago and throughout the West Indies. He continued his studies during 1982 in Senegal and Gambia. In 1987 and 1992 he traveled to Japan, where he taught and performed West African Drumming and Dancing. While in Japan he visited Sado Island, home of Kodo, the internationally acclaimed percussion group, in a cultural exchange program. He has also performed and lectured throughout the US as well as toured Germany, Italy and Israel producing, recording, conducting clinics and performing with his group Da Lion. Like his mentor Olatunji, (who played for many years with Santana and other popular artists of the day), Leon has succeeded in bringing African drumming into contemporary mainstream music and has performed and recorded with many major artists in all genres. Among the many artists Leon has worked with are: Dave Matthews Band, Jack Johnson, Peter Wolf, Mick Jagger, Quincy Jones, Santana, Michael Jackson, Macy Gray, Trevor Hall, Dirty Dozen Brass Band, Blind Boys of Alabama, Damian Marley, Jason Mraz, Madonna, The Fugees, Stevie Wonder, Gov't Mule, Michael Franti & Spearhead, Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine, Timoria, Pierce Fucinni, Airto and Flora Purim, and more. Most recently, Leon performed for a Gucci sponsored event at the United Nations which raised 5.5 million dollars for UNICEF and Madonna's charity Raising Malawi. In addition to opening the event with a rousing drum performance, Leon & Da Lion also accompanied the world acclaimed African Children's Choir. With the knowledge Leon garnered from studying with some of the greatest drummers in the world Leon is now regarded as a master drummer in his own rightTemplate:Whom?. Leon has been a signature series artist with Remo who has manufactured and marketed the Leon Mobley custom designed African drums since 1983. As an ever seeking student of African drumming and culture for over 30 years Leon has become a nationally and internationally sought teacher of West African Drumming and Culture. While in Boston he taught at community centers, conducted school tours with the Art of Black Dance and Music, and conducted workshops at Berklee College of Music. He also served as musical director at Paige Academy, a private school in Roxbury, Massachusetts. Leon continued teaching after moving to Los Angeles in 1986, conducting weekly classes at UCLA, Los Angeles Contemporary Dance Theater, Parks and Recreation, and the Los Angeles High School for the Arts on the campus of Cal State (Los Angeles). Leon also contracted with the Music Center on Tour Program and presented African drumming and dance to thousands of students throughout Southern California. Mobley is the founder and artistic and musical director of Da Lion and Djimbe West African Drummers and Dancers. He founded these two groups in order to help preserve African cultures, and present authentic traditional West African-American dance and music to North American audiences. Through these groups, Leon continues his mission of educating others about the West African people, their customs, history, and cultural arts as well as the influence of Traditional African drumming and music on African American art and culture. Connecting the dots between African and African American music Leon has developed a fresh new approach to drumming which he calls Traditional African American Music. This traditional approach to new music enables Leon to illuminate and bring to the forefront the traditional African drum rhythms from which many Jazz, Funk, R&B and Hip Hop rhythms are derived."@en .

As part of Miles Davis's Second Great Quintet, Hancock helped to redefine the role of a jazz rhythm section and was one of the primary architects of the \"post-bop\" sound. He was one of the first jazz musicians to embrace music synthesizers and funk music (characterized by syncopated drum beats). Hancock's music is often melodic and accessible; he has had many songs \"cross over\" and achieved success among pop audiences. His music embraces elements of funk and soul while adopting freer stylistic elements from jazz. In his jazz improvisation, he possesses a unique creative blend of jazz, blues, and modern classical music, with harmonic stylings much like the styles of Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel. Hancock's best-known solo works include \"Cantaloupe Island\", \"Watermelon Man\" (later performed by dozens of musicians, including bandleader Mongo Santamar\u00EDa), \"Maiden Voyage\", \"Chameleon\", and the singles \"I Thought It Was You\" and \"Rockit\". His 2007 tribute album River: The Joni Letters won the 2008 Grammy Award for Album of the Year, only the second jazz album ever to win the award after Getz/Gilberto in 1965. Hancock is a member of S\u014Dka Gakkai International. On July 22, 2011 at a ceremony in Paris, Hancock was named UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador for the promotion of Intercultural Dialogue.

The success the brothers had with their collaborative works has often overshadowed the creative role that Ira played. However, his mastery of songwriting continued after the early death of George. He wrote additional hit songs with composers Jerome Kern, Kurt Weill and Harold Arlen.

He acted in more than 100 films in roles covering a wide range of genres, from light comedy to serious drama. In his later years, Curtis made numerous television appearances. Although his early film roles were partly the result of his good looks, by the later half of the 1950s he became a notable and strong screen presence. He began proving himself to be a \u201Cfine dramatic actor,\u201D having the range to act in numerous dramatic and comedy roles. In his earliest parts he acted in a string of \"mediocre\" films, including swashbucklers, westerns, light comedies, sports films, and a musical. However, by the time he starred in Houdini (1953) with his wife Janet Leigh, \"his first clear success,\" notes critic David Thomson, his acting had progressed immensely. He won his first serious recognition as a skilled dramatic actor in Sweet Smell of Success (1957) with co-star Burt Lancaster. The following year he was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor in another drama, The Defiant Ones (1958). Curtis then gave what many believe was his best acting, three interrelated roles in the comedy Some Like It Hot (1959). Thomson calls it an \"outrageous film,\" and a survey carried out by the American Film Institute voted it the funniest American film ever made. It costarred Jack Lemmon and Marilyn Monroe, and was directed by Billy Wilder. That was followed by Blake Edwards\u2019 comedy Operation Petticoat (1959) with Cary Grant. They were both \u201Cfrantic comedies,\u201D and displayed \"his impeccable comic timing. \" He often collaborated with Edwards on later films. In 1960, he co-starred in Spartacus, which became another major hit for him. His stardom and film career declined considerably after the early 1960s. His most significant serious part came in 1968 when he starred in the true-life drama The Boston Strangler, which some consider his \"last major film role. \" The part reinforced his reputation as a serious actor with his \"chilling portrayal\" of serial killer Albert DeSalvo. He gained 30 pounds and had his face \"rebuilt\" with a false nose to look like the real DeSalvo.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scott_Joplin> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Scott Joplin (c. 1867/1868?\u00A0\u2013 April 1, 1917) was an African-American composer and pianist. Joplin achieved fame for his ragtime compositions, and was later dubbed \"The King of Ragtime\". During his brief career, he wrote 44 original ragtime pieces, one ragtime ballet, and two operas. One of his first pieces, the \"Maple Leaf Rag\", became ragtime's first and most influential hit, and has been recognized as the archetypal rag. {{#invoke:Footnotes|sfn}} Joplin was born into a musical family of laborers in Northeast Texas, and developed his musical knowledge with the help of local teachers, most notably Julius Weiss. Joplin grew up in Texarkana, where he formed a vocal quartet, and taught mandolin and guitar. During the late 1880s he left his job as a laborer with the railroad, and travelled around the American South as an itinerant musician. He went to Chicago for the World's Fair of 1893, which played a major part in making ragtime a national craze by 1897. Joplin moved to Sedalia, Missouri, in 1894, and earned a living as a piano teacher, continuing to tour the South. In Sedalia, he taught future ragtime composers Arthur Marshall, Scott Hayden and Brun Campbell. Joplin began publishing music in 1895, and publication of his \"Maple Leaf Rag\" in 1899 brought him fame. This piece had a profound influence on subsequent writers of ragtime. It also brought the composer a steady income for life. Joplin did not reach this level of success again and frequently had financial problems. Joplin moved to St. Louis in 1901, where he continued to compose and publish music, and regularly performed in the St Louis community. By the time he had moved to St. Louis, he may have been experiencing discoordination of the fingers, tremors, and an inability to speak clearly, as a result of having contracted syphilis. The score to his first opera, A Guest of Honor, was confiscated in 1903 with his belongings, owing to his non-payment of bills, and is considered lost. He continued to compose and publish music, and in 1907 moved to New York City, seeking to find a producer for a new opera. He attempted to go beyond the limitations of the musical form which made him famous, without much monetary success. His second opera, Treemonisha, was not received well at its partially staged performance in 1915. In 1916, suffering from tertiary syphilis and by consequence rapidly deteriorating health, Joplin descended into dementia. He was admitted to a mental institution in January 1917, and died there three months later at the age of 49. Joplin's music was rediscovered and returned to popularity in the early 1970s with the release of a million-selling album of Joplin's rags recorded by Joshua Rifkin, followed by the Academy Award\u2013winning movie The Sting, which featured several of his compositions, such as \"The Entertainer\". The opera Treemonisha was finally produced in full to wide acclaim in 1972. In 1976, Joplin was posthumously awarded a Pulitzer Prize."@en .

One of the most important American theatre composers of the early 20th century, he wrote more than 700 songs, used in over 100 stage works, including such classics as \"Ol' Man River\", \"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man\", \"A Fine Romance\", \"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\", \"All the Things You Are\", \"The Way You Look Tonight\", \"Long Ago (and Far Away)\" and \"Who?\". He collaborated with many of the leading librettists and lyricists of his era, including George Grossmith Jr. , Guy Bolton, P. G. Wodehouse, Otto Harbach, Oscar Hammerstein II, Dorothy Fields, Johnny Mercer, Ira Gershwin and E. Y. Harburg. A native New Yorker, Kern created dozens of Broadway musicals and Hollywood films in a career that lasted for more than four decades. His musical innovations, such as 4/4 dance rhythms and the employment of syncopation and jazz progressions, built on, rather than rejected, earlier musical theatre tradition. He and his collaborators also employed his melodies to further the action or develop characterization to a greater extent than in the other musicals of his day, creating the model for later musicals. Although dozens of Kern's musicals and musical films were hits, only Show Boat is now regularly revived. Songs from his other shows, however, are still frequently performed and adapted. Although Kern detested jazz arrangements of his songs, many have been adopted by jazz musicians to become standard tunes."@en .

His method of atonal counterpoint was based on a non-serial technique of avoiding repeating a pitch class until a generally fixed number such as eight pitch classes intervened. He wrote painstakingly slowly so his output is quite small. Famous for his prickly personality, Ruggles was nonetheless friends with Henry Cowell, Edgard Var\u00E8se, Charles Ives, Ruth Crawford Seeger, and Charles Seeger. His students include James Tenney and Merton Brown.

Rogers was one of the first Black comedians allowed to directly address a white audience when he worked. Before Rogers, African-American funny men had to either work in pairs or groups, only conversing with each other, and they had to play a character, while popular white comedians, such as Bob Hope and Jack Benny got to play themselves. Rogers worked by himself, always dressed well, often wearing a tuxedo, and never wore blackface. His humor was clean, topical, and political. Rogers was inducted into the National Comedy Hall of Fame in 1993, and is often called the Jackie Robinson of comedy, because he opened the door for other performers such as Dick Gregory and Bill Cosby. Timmie Rogers was born in Detroit on July 4, 1915. Rogers was earning nickels and dimes dancing on the street by the time he was 8. His father, the son of a slave, taught himself to read and he ran away from home at age 12. He took a job as a dishwasher on a boat, where he learned the languages of the cooks; eventually, he spoke nine. Rogers would later write and record in French and German. Later he cleaned ashtrays at a local ballroom, absorbed what he saw and was invited to dance onstage before acts. By 1932, Rogers was part of a successful dance team, Timmie & Freddie. They split in 1944 as blacks across the country were developing a collective voice in the name of civil rights, and Rogers decided to try it on his own, his way. He was known as the Unknown Pioneer of (Black) Comedy. He insisted on not wearing blackface when performing his comedy act and stood firm with his conviction. That didn't stop him as he was popular and very funny. His catchphrase was \"Oh Yeah!\" and it was a part of his act for over 50 years. Timmie starred in US television's first black prime-time show Sugar Hill Times in 1949. He was also a recurring guest star on the Jackie Gleason Show for over 12 years. He wrote music including a song for Nat King Cole. In the late 50's and living in Philadelphia, he recorded on Cameo and Parkway. His hits included \"Back to School Again\" and \"I Love Ya, I Love Ya, I Love Ya\". His songs had humor and good catchy melodies."@en .

By 16, he increasingly played jazz piano at parties, resorts and other venues. In 1924, he went to Harlem, where his performing career expanded; he toured with groups to the major jazz cities of Chicago, St. Louis and Kansas City. In 1929 he joined Bennie Moten's band in Kansas City, and played with them until Moten's death in 1935. That year Basie formed his own jazz orchestra, and in 1936 took them to Chicago for a long engagement and their first recording. He led the group for almost 50 years, creating innovations like the use of two \"split\" tenor saxophones, emphasizing the rhythm section, riffing with a big band, using arrangers to broaden their sound, and others. Many notable musicians came to prominence under his direction, including the tenor saxophonists Lester Young and Herschel Evans, the guitarist Freddie Green, trumpeters Buck Clayton and Harry \"Sweets\" Edison and singers Jimmy Rushing and Joe Williams.

In 1968, Russell along with songwriting partner Quincy Jones were nominated for an Academy Award in the Best Original Song category (\"The Eyes Of Love\" for the film Banning). The following year, both he and Jones were nominated again in the same category. Russell attended Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri where he was roommates with Sidney Sheldon the novelist. He then went to work as an advertising copywriter. Russell then turned to writing special material for vaudeville acts, and then for film studios, ultimately writing complete scores for two movies: Jack and the Beanstalk and Reach for Glory. The latter film received the Locarno International Film Festival prize in 1962. A number of other movies featured compositions by Russell: Affair in Trinidad, Blue Gardenia, The Girl Can't Help It, The Girl Most Likely, Matter of Who, Meet Captain Kidd, Sound-Off, That Midnight Kiss, and Ticket to Tomahawk. In the movies The Girl Most Likely, Blue Gardenia, and Matter of Who, Russell's compositions included the title songs. He had his last hit song in 1969-70, with \"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother\" recorded by The Hollies. The song was introduced to the group by Russell's son-in-law Jefferey Spearitt, who was living in London at the time with his wife Simohn. Among his collaborators were Lou Alter, Peter De Rose, Duke Ellington, Bronislaw Kaper, Lester Lee, Carl Sigman, Harold Spina, and Harry Warren. In 1970 he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Russell died from cancer in February 1970. In 2004 he was posthumously awarded the ASCAP lifetime achievement award in \"Pop\" music."@en .

Monk had a unique improvisational style and made numerous contributions to the standard jazz repertoire, including \"Epistrophy\", \"'Round Midnight\", \"Blue Monk\", \"Straight, No Chaser\" and \"Well, You Needn't\". Monk is the second-most recorded jazz composer after Duke Ellington, which is particularly remarkable as Ellington composed over 1,000 songs while Monk wrote about 70. His compositions and improvisations are full of dissonant harmonies and angular melodic twists, and are consistent with Monk's unorthodox approach to the piano, which combined a highly percussive attack with abrupt, dramatic use of silences and hesitations. Since this was not a style universally appreciated, poet and jazz critic Philip Larkin dismissed Monk as \"the elephant on the keyboard\". Monk's manner was idiosyncratic. Visually, he was renowned for his distinctive style in suits, hats and sunglasses. He was also noted for the fact that at times, while the other musicians in the band continued playing, he would stop, stand up from the keyboard and dance for a few moments before returning to the piano. He is one of five jazz musicians to have been featured on the cover of Time as of 2010."@en .

In 1941 he joined Lionel Hampton for two years, before signing with Count Basie, with whom he stayed for a total of thirteen years, interrupted by short breaks and a long period (1947\u20131952) spent first with saxophonist Illinois Jacquet and then drummer J. C. Heard. During his second period with Basie, which lasted for about nine years, he made a number of small-group recordings as leader. He also played on Benny Goodman's 1962 tour of the Soviet Union. In 1961 Newman left the Basie band, and helped to found Jazz Interactions, of which he became president in 1967. His wife, Rigmor Alfredsson Newman was the Executive Director. Jazz Interactions was a charitable organisation which provided an information service, brought jazz master classes into schools and colleges, and later maintained its own Jazz Interaction Orchestra (for which Newman wrote). In the 1970s and 1980s Newman toured internationally, and recorded for various major record labels. He suffered a stroke in 1991, however, which seriously disabled him."@en .

Martin's favorite tool was a crowquill pen which enabled him to do delicate line work. CBS-TV art director William Golden gave Martin many print ad assignments during the 1950s, and Martin soon expanded into illustration for Seventeen, The Saturday Evening Post and other slick magazines of the 1950s and 1960s.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maya_Angelou> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Maya Angelou is an American author and poet. She has published six autobiographies, five books of essays, several books of poetry, and is credited with a list of plays, movies, and television shows spanning more than fifty years. She has received dozens of awards and over thirty honorary doctoral degrees. Angelou is best known for her series of autobiographies, which focus on her childhood and early adult experiences. The first, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969), tells of her life up to the age of seventeen, and brought her international recognition and acclaim. Angelou's list of occupations includes pimp, prostitute, night-club dancer and performer, castmember of the opera Porgy and Bess, coordinator for Martin Luther King, Jr. 's Southern Christian Leadership Conference, author, journalist in Egypt and Ghana during the days of decolonization, and actor, writer, director, and producer of plays, movies, and public television programs. Since 1982, she has taught at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where she holds the first lifetime Reynolds Professorship of American Studies. She was active in the Civil Rights movement, and worked with both Martin Luther King and Malcolm X. Since the 1990s she has made around eighty appearances a year on the lecture circuit, something she continued into her eighties. In 1993, Angelou recited her poem \"On the Pulse of Morning\" at President Bill Clinton's inauguration, the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since Robert Frost at John F. Kennedy's inauguration in 1961. With the publication of I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Angelou was one of the first African American women who was able to publicly discuss her personal life. She is respected as a spokesperson of Black people and women, and her works have been considered a defense of Black culture. Although attempts have been made to ban her books from some US libraries, her works are widely used in schools and universities worldwide. Angelou's major works have been labeled as autobiographical fiction, but many critics have characterized them as autobiographies. She has made a deliberate attempt to challenge the common structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre. Her books center on themes such as racism, identity, family, and travel. Angelou is best known for her autobiographies, but she is also an established poet, although her poems have received mixed reviews."@en .

Smith was born in Pembroke, Georgia. At the age of 6 he went into the Jenkins Orphanage in Charleston, South Carolina where he learned trumpet and trombone, and by age 10 was touring with the Jenkins Band. At age 16 he left the Orphanage to become a professional musician, at first playing in bands in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Atlantic City, New Jersey before making his base in Manhattan, New York City from about 1925 through 1928, where he made the first of his well regarded recordings. In 1928 he toured with James P. Johnson's Orchestra when their show broke up in Chicago, Illinois, where Smith stayed for a few years. His series of 20 recordings for Brunswick Records in 1929 are his most famous (19 were issued), and Smith was billed as a rival to Louis Armstrong. Unfortunately, most of these records didn't sell well enough for Brunswick to extend his contract. In March 1935 in Chicago, Smith was featured in a recording session produced by Helen Oakley under the name of Charles LaVere & His Chicagoans, which included a vocal by both Smith and LaVere on LaVere's composition and arrangement of \"Boogaboo Blues\". It is an early example of inter-racial blues recordings, although far from the first as such had been made at least since c. 1921. In the 1930s, Smith moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin which would be his main base for many years, alternating with returns to New York. In Milwaukee he collaborated with saxophonist Bill Johnson. Subsequently, Smith dropped out of the public eye, playing music part time in Milwaukee with a regular job at an automobile hire company. Jabbo Smith made a comeback starting in the late 1960s. Many young musicians, fans, and record collectors were surprised to learn that the star of those great 1920s recordings was still alive. Smith successfully played with bands and shows in New York, New Orleans, Louisiana, London, and France through the 1970s and into the 1980s.

His experiments begun three decades ago in rhythm, in harmony, and in instrumental sonorities were considered then by many to be wild. Today they are the Bible of the young and still, to the conservatives, \"advanced.\"... No other composer of our time has produced a body of works so radical and so normal, so penetrating and so comprehensive.

The Chicago Outfit, which subsequently also became known as the \"Capones,\" was dedicated to smuggling and bootlegging liquor, and other illegal activities such as prostitution, in Chicago from the early 1920s to 1931. Born in the borough of Brooklyn in New York City to Italian immigrants, Capone became involved with gang activity at a young age after being expelled from school at age 14. In his early twenties, he moved to Chicago to take advantage of a new opportunity to make money smuggling illegal alcoholic beverages into the city during Prohibition. He also engaged in various other criminal activities, including bribery of government figures and prostitution. Despite his illegitimate occupation, Capone became a highly visible public figure. He made donations to various charitable endeavors using the money he made from his activities, and was viewed by many to be a \"modern-day Robin Hood\". Capone's public reputation was damaged in the wake of his supposed involvement in the 1929 Saint Valentine's Day Massacre, when seven rival gang members were executed. Capone was convicted on federal charges of tax evasion in 1931 and sentenced to federal prison; he was released on parole in 1939. His incarceration included a term at the then-new Alcatraz federal prison. In the final years of Capone's life, he suffered mental and physical deterioration due to late-stage neurosyphilis, which he had contracted in his youth. On January 25, 1947, he died from cardiac arrest after suffering a stroke."@en .

He is considered one of the originators of vocalese, which adds lyrics to existing instrumental songs and replaces many instruments with vocalists (such as the big-band arrangements of Duke Ellington and Count Basie). Furthermore, he is considered one of the best practitioners of scat singing, which involves vocal jazz soloing. For his work as a lyricist, jazz critic and historian Leonard Feather called him the \"Poet Laureate of Jazz\" while Time dubbed him the \"James Joyce of Jive. \" Al Jarreau has called him \"pound-for-pound the best jazz singer on the planet\u2014maybe that's ever been\". Born in 1921 in Newark, Ohio, Hendricks and his 14 siblings were moved many times, following their father's assignments as an A.M.E. pastor, before settling permanently in Toledo. There, Hendricks began his singing career at the age of 7. He has said: \"By the time I was 10, I was a local celebrity in Toledo. I had offers to go with Fats Waller when I was 12, and offers to go with Ted Lewis and be his shadow when I was 13. He had that song 'Me and My Shadow'. And he had this little Negro boy who was his shadow, that did everything he did. That was his act. \" As a teenager, Jon's first interest was in the drums, but before long he was singing on the radio regularly with another Toledo native, pianist Art Tatum."@en .

Turner started out her music career in the mid-1950s as a featured singer with Ike Turner's Kings of Rhythm, first recording in 1958 under the name Little Ann with the song, \"Box Top\". Her introduction to the public as Tina Turner began in the early 1960s with Ike as a member of the Ike & Tina Turner Revue. {{#invoke:Footnotes|sfn}} Success followed with a string of notable hits including \"River Deep \u2013 Mountain High\" (1966) and \"Proud Mary\" (1971). Turner later revealed several severe instances of domestic abuse in her autobiography, I, Tina, against her by Ike Turner prior to their 1976 split and subsequent 1978 divorce. Raised a Baptist, Turner converted to Buddhism in 1974, crediting the religion and its spiritual chants for getting her through difficult times in her life. Following her divorce from Ike Turner, she rebuilt her career by constantly performing although she struggled to make an impact on the music charts as a solo artist. Finally in the early 1980s, she launched an astounding comeback with another string of hits starting in 1983 with the single \"Let's Stay Together\" followed by the 1984 release of her fifth solo album Private Dancer which became a phenomenal success worldwide. \"What's Love Got to Do with It,\" the most popular single from the album, would later serve as the title of a biographical film about Turner that was adapted from her autobiography. In addition to her music career, Turner has also experienced success in movies, including a role in the 1975 rock musical, Tommy and a starring role in the 1985 Mel Gibson action flick, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, later appearing in a cameo role in the 1993 film, Last Action Hero. One of the world's most popular entertainers, Turner has been called the most successful female rock artist, winning 8 Grammys and selling more concert tickets than any other solo performer in history. She has also been named \"one of the greatest singers of all time\" by Rolling Stone. Her combined album and single sales total approximately 200 million copies worldwide. She is known for her energetic stage presence, powerful vocals, career longevity, and widespread appeal. In 2008, Turner left semi-retirement to embark on her Tina!: 50th Anniversary Tour. Turner's tour became one of the highest selling ticketed shows of 2008\u20132009. Rolling Stone ranked her at 63 on their 100 greatest artists of all time and considers her the \"Queen of Rock and Roll,\" as do The New York Times, Oprah Winfrey, Elton John, Mick Jagger, and Cher."@en .

Konitz was one of the few altoists to retain a distinctive sound when Charlie Parker exercised a tremendous influence on other players. Konitz, like other students of pianist and theoretician Lennie Tristano, was noted for improvising long, melodic lines with the rhythmic interest coming from odd accents, or odd note groupings suggestive of the imposition of one time signature over another. Paul Desmond and, especially, Art Pepper were strongly influenced by Konitz. Konitz's association with the Cool Jazz movement of the 1940s and 50s, includes participation in Miles Davis' Birth of the Cool sessions, and his work with Lennie Tristano came from the same period.

Born Theodora King in Boston, Massachusetts on September 18, 1929, she won a singing competition hosted by Dinah Shore at Boston's Tributary Theatre, later beginning work in a touring revue involved with \"cheering up the military in the lull between the Second World War and the Korean conflict. \" Improving her vocal and piano technique during this time, she first recorded with Nat Pierce in 1949, later recording with the Beryl Booker trio and with several other small groups from 1954-1955 (recordings which were available on three albums for Storyville). She then toured with George Shearing for two years beginning in the summer of 1952, and for a time was managed by the famed George Wein. King later began performing for a time in Las Vegas. Ultimately signing with RCA, she recorded three albums for the label, beginning with 1956's Bidin' My Time. She also had some minor chart success with the singles \"Mr. Wonderful\" (which made the Top 20 in 1956), \"Married I Can Always Get\" and \"Say It Isn't So\" (both of which made the Hot 100 from 1957\u20131958). Her critically praised 1959 album All the Kings' Songs found her interpreting the signature songs of contemporary male singers like Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole (the \"kings\" of the title). In the 1960s, she opened the Playboy Club, where she often performed. After developing lupus, she managed to make a brief comeback with a 1977 album featuring Dave McKenna, and with two more albums recorded for Audiophile released posthumously. She eventually died of the disease on November 18, 1977. King's style, influenced by Lee Wiley, Mildred Bailey and Mabel Mercer, has won her a small but devoted cult following."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buddie_Petit> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Buddie Petit or Buddy Petit (ca. 1890? \u2013 4 July 1931) was a highly regarded early jazz cornetist. His early life is somewhat mysterious, with dates of his birth given in various sources ranging from 1887 to 1897; if the later date is correct he was evidently a prodigy, regarded as one of the best in New Orleans, Louisiana, in his early teens. He was said to have been born in White Castle, Louisiana. His given name was Joseph Crawford, but he was adopted by the trombonist Joseph Petit, whose name he took. By the early 1910s, he was one of the top horn players in the new style of music not yet generally known as \"jazz\". He took Freddie Keppard's place in the Eagle Band (a place earlier held by Buddy Bolden) when Keppard left town. Buddie Petit was known as a hard-drinking, fun-loving man who played cornet with great virtuosity and inventiveness. He was briefly lured to Los Angeles, California, by Jelly Roll Morton and Bill Johnson in 1917, but objected to being told to dress and behave differently than he was accustomed to back home, and promptly returned to New Orleans. He spent the rest of his career in the area around greater New Orleans and the towns north of Lake Pontchartrain like Mandeville, Louisiana, not venturing further from home than Baton Rouge and the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Okeh Records offered him a chance to record on their 1925 field trip to New Orleans, but Petit held out for more money and was never recorded. Musicians such as Danny Barker and Louis Armstrong have said that it is a great loss to jazz history that there are no recordings of Petit. Some of his contemporaries said that Louis Armstrong's record \"Cornet Chop Suey\" is the closest to Petit's style and sound of anything put on record."@en .

He composed and produced jazz compositions for artists including Miles Davis, Mahalia Jackson, Dave Brubeck, Art Blakey, Leonard Bernstein, Freddie McCoy and Louis Armstrong. He was the second child of Hettie Marina and William Lorenzo Lampley, and had a brother named William Elwood. He received an alumni with a B.S. from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in Greensboro, North Carolina. His first known music contribution was as an organist of the Chapel Hill Presbyterian, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's on-campus church. There he formed a group that was later going to be the first all-black, 45-piece band in the then white-only Navy, calling the \"US Navy B-1 Band\". Lampley moved to New York City in 1946 to continue his education at the Juilliard School Of Music. With an Artist Diploma in 1949 in piano after three years under the direction of piano teacher Irwin Freundlich and composer Richard Franko Goldman, Lampley deputed his performance as a pianist at the Carnegie Hall concert in 1953. After having received a job as a tape editor at Columbia Records, he was later hired by record producer George Avakian, which would later become his assistant, to work as an A&R and as a record producer for music labels such as Columbia, Warner Bros. , RCA/Victor, and Prestige. His own version of the composition \"Misty\" by jazz musician Richard \"Groove\" Holmes was Prestige's Records biggest single in its entire history, which peaked at number 44 on the Billboard charts in 1966. On July 6, 2006 Lampley died at the Baltimore Washington Medical Center in Baltimore from complications of Multiple Sclerosis. In tribute to his musical contribution to the city and the state, Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke officially promulgated the \"Cal Lampley Day\" on May 1, 1994 in Baltimore at a City Hall ceremony."@en .

He went on to join Gerry Mulligan's quartet and to co-found the Jazztet, with Benny Golson. Continuing to develop his own sound, Farmer switched from trumpet to the warmer flugelhorn in the early 1960s, helping to develop its reputation as a soloist's instrument in jazz. He settled in Europe in 1968, continuing to tour internationally until his death. He recorded more than 50 albums under his own name, a dozen with the Jazztet, and dozens more with other leaders.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Willie_Nelson> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Willie Hugh Nelson is an American country music singer-songwriter, as well as an author, poet, actor, and activist. The critical success of the album Shotgun Willie (1973), combined with the critical and commercial success of Red Headed Stranger (1975) and Stardust (1978), made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. He was one of the main figures of outlaw country, a subgenre of country music that developed at the end of the 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the Nashville sound. Nelson has acted in over 30 films, co-authored several books, and has been involved in activism for the use of biofuels and the legalization of marijuana. Born during the Great Depression, and raised by his grandparents, Nelson wrote his first song at age seven and joined his first band at ten. During high school, he toured locally with the Bohemian Polka as their lead singer and guitar player. After graduating from high school in 1950, he joined the Air Force but was later discharged due to back problems. After his return, Nelson attended Baylor University for two years but dropped out because he was succeeding in music. During this time, he worked as a disc jockey in Texas radio stations and a singer in honky tonks. Nelson moved to Vancouver, Washington, where he wrote \"Family Bible\" and recorded the song \"Lumberjack\" in 1956. In 1960, he signed a publishing contract with Pamper Music which allowed him to join Ray Price's band as a bassist. During that time, he wrote songs that would become country standards, including \"Funny How Time Slips Away\", \"Hello Walls\", \"Pretty Paper\", and \"Crazy\". In 1962, he recorded his first album, And Then I Wrote. Due to this success, Nelson signed in 1964 with RCA Victor and joined the Grand Ole Opry the following year. After mid-chart hits in the late 1960s and the early 1970s, Nelson retired in 1972 and moved to Austin, Texas. The rise of the popularity of hippie music in Austin motivated Nelson to return from retirement, performing frequently at the Armadillo World Headquarters. In 1973, after signing with Atlantic Records, Nelson turned to outlaw country, including albums such as Shotgun Willie and Phases and Stages. In 1975, he switched to Columbia Records, where he recorded the critically acclaimed album, Red Headed Stranger. The same year, he recorded another outlaw country album, Wanted! The Outlaws, along with Waylon Jennings, Jessi Colter, and Tompall Glaser. During the mid-1980s, while creating hit albums like Honeysuckle Rose and recording hit songs like \"On the Road Again\", \"To All the Girls I've Loved Before\", and \"Pancho & Lefty\", he joined the country supergroup The Highwaymen, along with fellow singers Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, and Kris Kristofferson. In 1990 Nelson's assets were seized by the Internal Revenue Service, which claimed that he owed US $32,000,000. It was later discovered that his accountants, Price Waterhouse, did not pay Nelson's taxes for years. The difficulty of paying his outstanding debt was aggravated by weak investments he had made during the 1980s. In 1991, Nelson released The IRS Tapes: Who'll Buy My Memories?; by 1993, the profits of the double album, destined to the IRS, and the auction of Nelson's assets cleared his debt. During the 1990s and 2000s, Nelson continued touring extensively, and released albums every year. Reviews ranged from positive to mixed. He explored genres such as reggae, blues, jazz, and folk. Nelson made his first movie appearance in the 1979 film The Electric Horseman, followed by other appearances in movies and on television. Nelson is a major liberal activist and the co-chair of the advisory board of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, which is in favor of marijuana legalization. On the environmental front, Nelson owns the bio-diesel brand Willie Nelson Biodiesel, which is made from vegetable oil. Nelson is also the honorary chairman of the Advisory Board of the Texas Music Project, the official music charity of the state of Texas."@en .

Ayler was among the most primal of the free jazz musicians of the 1960s; critic John Litweiler wrote that \"never before or since has there been such naked aggression in jazz\" He possessed a deep blistering tone\u2014achieved by using the stiff plastic Fibrecane no. 4 reeds on his tenor saxophone\u2014and used a broad, pathos-filled vibrato. His trio and quartet records of 1964, like Spiritual Unity and The Hilversum Session, show him advancing the improvisational notions of John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman into abstract realms where whole timbre, and not just mainly harmony with melody, is the music's backbone. His ecstatic music of 1965 and 1966, like \"Spirits Rejoice\" and \"Truth Is Marching In\" has been compared by critics to the sound of a brass band, and involved simple, march-like themes which alternated with wild group improvisations and were regarded as retrieving jazz's pre-Louis Armstrong roots."@en .

This is relational to trad jazz as the musicians tended to be white and had little or no actual connections to New Orleans. He played trumpet by the age of 11 and had his first work on a cruise ship. He then worked for Bob Crosby before deciding to form a Dixieland-style band. He founded the Yerba Buena Jazz Band in 1939 and it would be a leading force in the Dixieland revival for the next 11 years, with a small off-period caused by the war. In 1950 he broke up the band and in 1957 he retired from full-time playing. In his life after music, he studied geology and lectured on the subject at Sonoma State University. His main area of interest was coastal earthquake conditions. He also became a chef. In 1963 he made a bit of a return by playing with Turk Murphy at anti-nuclear rallies. He opposed building a nuclear plant on the San Andreas Fault. This related to his interest in geology and study of earthquakes. After this he returned to his life as a geologist and chef."@en .

During a career spanning more than half a century, he recorded exclusively for the RCA Victor label after signing with them in 1943. \"Mr. C. \", as he was nicknamed, sold millions of records for Radio Corporation of America (RCA) and pioneered a weekly musical variety television show, which set the standards for the genre and proved to be one of the most successful in television history. Como was seen weekly on television from 1949 to 1963, then continued hosting the Kraft Music Hall variety program on a monthly basis until 1967. His television shows and seasonal specials were broadcast throughout the world. Also a popular recording artist, Perry Como produced numerous hit records with record sales so high the label literally stopped counting at Como's behest. His combined success on television and popular recordings was not matched by any other artist of the time. Como's appeal spanned generations and he was widely respected for both his professional standards and the conduct in his personal life. In the official RCA Records Billboard magazine memorial, his life was summed up in these few words: \"50 years of music and a life well lived. An example to all. \" Composer Ervin Drake said of him, \"... \u00A0[o o]ccasionally someone like Perry comes along and won't 'go with the flow' and still prevails in spite of all the bankrupt others who surround him and importune him to yield to their values. Only occasionally. \" One of the many factors in his success was Como's insistence on his principles of good taste; if he considered something to be in bad or poor taste, it was not in the show or broadcast. When a remark made by Julius La Rosa about television personality Arthur Godfrey on The Perry Como Show was misconstrued, Como offered an on-air apology at the beginning of his next show, against the advice of his staff. While his performance of \"Ave Maria\" was a tradition of his holiday television programs, Como refused to sing it at live performances, saying, \"It's not the time or place to do it\", even though it was the number-one request of his audiences. Another was his naturalness; the man viewers saw on the screen was the same person who could be encountered behind a supermarket shopping cart, at a bowling alley, or in a kitchen making breakfast. From his first Chesterfield Supper Club television show, if scripts were written at all, they were based on the way Como would say something. Como was not devoid of a temper, and it could be seen at times as a result of the frustrations of daily life. His music director from 1948 \u2013 1963, Mitchell Ayres, said, \"Perry has a temper like everyone else. And he loses his temper at the normal things everyone else does. When we're driving, for instance, and somebody cuts him off, he really lets the offender have it. \" Como received the 1959 Grammy Award for Best Vocal Performance, Male; five Emmys from 1955 to 1959; a Christopher Award (1956) and shared a Peabody Award with good friend Jackie Gleason in 1956. He was inducted into the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Hall of Fame in 1990 and received a Kennedy Center Honor in 1987. Posthumously, Como received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2002; he was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2006. Como has the distinction of having three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work in radio, television, and music."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ray_Bauduc> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Ray Bauduc (June 18, 1906 \u2013 January 8, 1988) was a jazz drummer best known for his work with the Bob Crosby Orchestra and their band-within-a-band, the Bobcats, between 1935 and 1942. Bauduc was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. He was the son of the cornetist Jules Bauduc and his elder brother Jules was also a professional musician, a banjoist-bandleader. Ray Bauduc's youthful work in New Orleans included stints in the band of Johnny Bayersdorffer and early radio broadcasts. His New Orleans origins instilled in him a love for two-beat drumming, which he retained even when he played with Bob Crosby's swing era big band. In 1926 he moved to New York City to join Joe Venuti's band. His other work in the 1920s include recording sessions with the Original Memphis Five and a stint in the Scranton Sirens which also included Tommy Dorsey and Jimmy Dorsey. His stint with the Bob Crosby Orchestra brought him national fame. He co-composed, together with bassist Bob Haggart, the two big hits that the Bob Crosby orchestra achieved: \"South Rampart Street Parade\" (a New Orleans parade-type number first recorded in November 1937), and \"Big Noise from Winnetka\" (a bass and drums duet with Haggart, recorded in 1938). His style, making use of woodblocks, cowbells, the China cymbal and tom-toms, marked him out from most drummers of the swing era, and made him one of the few white drummers (the others being George Wettling, Dave Tough and Gene Krupa, but they were not so obvious) to be directly influenced by Warren \"Baby\" Dodds. Ray Bauduc was a trend setter in traditional jazz circles. His precise, disciplined, yet fiery patterns and syncopated fills helped New Orleans drummers make the transition into swing from the rigid, clipped progressions that had defined the previous era. The son of the great cornetist Jules Bauduc, his brother Jules Jr. taught Bauduc drums. His sister was also a musician, a pianist. Bauduc's first professional job came with a band that accompanied films. Bauduc served in the U.S. Army Artillery Band until November of 1944. Upon his discharge he and former Crosby group leader Gil Rodin formed a short-lived big band. Bauduc toured with a septet in 1946 and also worked in Tommy Dorsey's orchestra from August to October of the year. In early 1947 he joined Bob Crosby's new group, leaving in 1948 to play with Jimmy Dorsey, where he stayed for the next two years. He freelanced on the West Coast for a couple of years before joining Jack Teagarden in 1952. In 1955 he formed a band with fellow Crosby alumnus Nappy Lamare. The new outfit found considerable success, touring nationally and recording several albums. He retired to Bellaire, Texas, in the early 1960s. From 1960, Bauduc lived in Bellaire, Texas in semi-retirement, but visited New Orleans in 1983 where he was greeted effusively. He also appeared occasionally at Crosby Orchestra reunions and worked with Pud Brown on several recordings His best known student from his teaching days in Bellaire, Texas is Charlie Harrington. After the break-up of the Crosby band, Bauduc organized his own small groups (often in a swing or even bebop style), rejoined Bob Crosby for occasional reunions, worked with Jimmy Dorsey (1948) and Jack Teagarden (1952\u201355), before joining fellow ex-Bobcat Nappy Lamare in a highly successful dixieland band that lasted until 1960, after which Bauduc went into semi-retirement in Bellaire, Texas. He died in Houston, Texas on January 8, 1988."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Percy_Humphrey> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Percy Gaston Humphrey (January 13, 1905 \u2013 July 22, 1995) was a jazz trumpet player and bandleader in New Orleans, Louisiana. In addition to his own jazz band, Percy Humphrey and His Crescent City Joymakers, for more than thirty years he was leader of the Eureka Brass Band. He also played in the band of the pianist Sweet Emma Barrett. From its opening in the early 1960s, until shortly before his death Humphrey played regularly at Preservation Hall, traveling internationally for performances with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band and his own bands. Percy Humphrey was the son of clarinetist Willie Eli Humphrey, as well as being the younger brother of clarinetist Willie Humphrey and trombonist Earl Humphrey. His grandfather was the renowned \"Professor\" Jim Humphrey, who took the train from New Orleans to sugar cane plantations during the 1890s, in order to teach the basics of music to the children of plantation workers. Many of those he taught would play the jazz that was born in New Orleans near the turn of the twentieth century\u2014including these members of the two following generations of his own family. The Eureka Brass Band had been founded in 1920, by trumpeter Willie Wilson, and its early members included clarinetists Willie Parker, John Casimir, and George Lewis. In the 1930s Wilson became ill, during which time trumpeter Alcide Landry had nominal control over the band, but after 1937, Wilson's illness forced him to leave completely. At that time, trombonist Joseph \"Red\" Clark briefly became the leader, followed by Dominique \"T-Boy\" Remy, who led it from 1937 through 1946. Finally, Humphrey took over the band and led the group for the remainder of its existence. The members of the band varied at any given time, usually having nine to eleven members. The typical instrumentation was three trumpets, two trombones, two reeds, tuba, snare drum, and bass drum. Reed instruments are many, including the saxophones that often are found among jazz bands, but the clarinet is characteristically the signature reed instrument of New Orleans jazz. They recorded prolifically. Phonograph records and albums were cut for Pax, Alamac, Folkways, Jazzology, and Sounds of New Orleans. A 1951 album, New Orleans Parade, features Humphrey, trombonists Charles \"Sunny\" Henry and Albert Warner, and saxophonist Emanuel Paul. Their 1962 sessions, Jazz at Preservation Hall, Volume 1: the Eureka Brass Band of New Orleans, issued on Atlantic Records, features Humphrey and his brother, clarinetist Willie Humphrey, trumpeters Kid Sheik Cola and Pete Bocage, trombonists Albert Warner and Oscar \"Chicken\" Henry, Emanuel Paul on tenor saxophone, Wilbert \"Bird\" Tillman on sousaphone, snare drummer Josiah \"Cie\" Frazier, and bass drummer Robert \"Son Fewclothes\" Lewis. After 1975, the Eureka Brass Band disbanded, but Humphrey revived the name occasionally for festival performances and other appearances. He continued to lead his own band and played with others at Preservation Hall until his death in New Orleans in 1995. His last gig was at the annual New Orleans jazz festival in April, three months before his death at the age of ninety."@en .

Robinson was born in Detroit, Michigan. At an early age he showed unusual gifts singing the blues and accompanying himself on the piano. He won a talent show at the Paradise Theatre in Detroit at the age of three, and in 1945 played guest spots at the theatre with Lionel Hampton, who was prevented by child protection legislation from taking him on tour with him. However, he performed on radio with Hampton and Harry \"The Hipster\" Gibson, and also appeared as himself in the Hollywood film No Leave, No Love, starring Van Johnson and Keenan Wynn. In 1946, he played for President Harry S. Truman at the White House, shouting out \"How'm I Doin', Mr President?\" \u2013 which became his catchphrase \u2013 during his performance of \"Caldonia\". He began touring major theatres, setting box office records in Detroit and California. In 1949 he was given special permission to join the American Federation of Musicians and record, his first releases on Capitol Records, \"Numbers Boogie\" and \"Caldonia\", both reaching the Billboard R&B chart. In 1950, he toured and appeared on television with Count Basie, and appeared in a short film 'Sugar Chile' Robinson, Billie Holiday, Count Basie and His Sextet. The following year, he toured the UK, appearing at the London Palladium. He stopped recording in 1952, later explaining:\"I wanted to go to school... I wanted some school background in me and I asked my Dad if I could stop, and I went to school because I honestly wanted my college diploma. \" Until 1956 he continued to make occasional appearances as a jazz musician, billed as Frank Robinson, and performed on one occasion with Gerry Mulligan, but then gave up his musical career entirely. Continuing his academic studies, he earned a degree in history from Olivet College and one in psychology from the Detroit Institute of Technology. In the 1960s, he worked for WGPR-TV, and also helped set up small record labels in Detroit and opened a recording studio. In recent years he has made a comeback as a musician with the help of the American Music Research Foundation. In 2002, he appeared at a special concert celebrating Detroit music, and in 2007 he traveled to Britain to appear at a rock and roll weekend festival."@en .

Sharkey was known for playing searing hot and technically virtuoso trumpet with a beautiful tone. His great musical abilities were sometimes overlooked in part because of his love of being an entertainer; he would often sing silly lyrics in a high raspy voice and break into dance routines on stage. Sharkey was born with the name Joseph Gustaf Bonano in the Milneburg neighborhood of New Orleans, Louisiana, by the shores of Lake Pontchartrain. He was a well regarded professional player by his mid teens, in his youth mostly playing in New Orleans other than a period with Eddie Edwards' band in New York City in 1920. Sharkey then started traveling widely, seldom staying in one place or with one band for more than a few months. He briefly replaced Bix Beiderbecke in the Wolverines Orchestra, and Nick LaRocca in the Original Dixieland Jazz Band. Sharkey first recorded in New Orleans with Norman Brownlee's band in 1925, and soon after had a band under his own name. He returned to New York for work in Jimmie Durante's band, then with the Jean Goldkette Orchestra in 1927, returned to his home town to play with Leon Prima, to Los Angeles, California to work with Larry Shields. After time back in New Orleans played with the Ben Pollack Orchestra in 1936. After leaving Pollack's band he led his own band on 52nd Street in New York for three years. After World War II he toured Europe, Asia, and South America, played residencies in Chicago and New York, and then was a regular on Bourbon Street in the New Orleans French Quarter. According to one story, Arturo Toscanini heard Sharkey in New York, then hired him to come to a rehearsal of the New York Philharmonic to play a couple of numbers unaccompanied for the orchestra to listen to. After Sharkey did this, Toscanini berated his trumpet section at length about their inabilities to get tones out of their instruments like this jazz musician could. Sharkey Bonano died in New Orleans."@en .

He is widely considered to be one of the most important and influential composers of the 20th century. Stravinsky's compositional career was notable for its stylistic diversity. He first achieved international fame with three ballets commissioned by the impresario Sergei Diaghilev and first performed in Paris by Diaghilev's Ballets Russes: The Firebird (1910), Petrushka (1911) and The Rite of Spring (1913). The last of these transformed the way in which subsequent composers thought about rhythmic structure and was largely responsible for Stravinsky's enduring reputation as a musical revolutionary who pushed the boundaries of musical design. His \"Russian phase\" was followed in the 1920s by a period in which he turned to neoclassical music. The works from this period tended to make use of traditional musical forms. They often paid tribute to the music of earlier masters, such as J.S. Bach and Tchaikovsky. In the 1950s, Stravinsky adopted serial procedures. His compositions of this period shared traits with examples of his earlier output: rhythmic energy, the construction of extended melodic ideas out of a few two- or three-note cells and clarity of form, of instrumentation and of utterance."@en .

In 1928, he moved to Kansas City and toured with Andy Kirk's territory band Twelve Clouds of Joy, which also included Mary Lou Williams, and further honed his musicianship by participating in jam sessions. Count Basie discovered him in Kansas City and later invited him to play rhythm guitar in his band. From the late 1960s, he often played with fellow Kansas City resident Jay McShann.

Kirk grew up in Denver, CO, where he was tutored under the wing of Wilberforce Whiteman, Paul Whiteman\u2019s father. He started his musical career playing with George Morrison's band, but then went on to join Terrence Holder's Dark Clouds of Joy. In 1929 he was elected leader after Holder departed. Renaming the band to Clouds of Joy, Andy Kirk also relocated the band from Dallas, Texas, to Kansas City, Kansas. Although officially titled as the Clouds of Joy, the band has also been known to be called the Twelve Clouds of Joy due to the number of musicians in the band. They set up in the Pla-Mor Ballroom on the junction of 32nd and Main in Kansas City and made their first recording for Brunswick Records that same year. Mary Lou Williams came in as pianist at the last moment, but she impressed Brunswick's Dave Kapp, so she became a regular member of the band. The pianist she replaced, Marion Jackson, did not take well to this but otherwise Kirk's band would be fairly stable with the incorporation of Williams. Kirk moved the band to Kansas City, and since their first recordings in 1929-1930, they grew highly popular as they epitomized the Kansas City jazz sound. In mid-1936, he was signed to Decca and made scores of popular records until 1946. He presumably disbanded and reformed his band during that 6 year recording layoff. In 1942, Kirk and His Clouds of Joy recorded \"Take It and Git\", which on October 24, 1942, became the first single to hit number one on the Harlem Hit Parade, the predecessor to the Billboard R&B chart. In 1943, with June Richmond on vocals, he had a number 4 hit with \"Hey Lawdy Mama\"."@en .

Henderson (November 22, 1904 \u2013 August 29, 1988), the younger brother of Fletcher Henderson, was an American jazz pianist, organist, arranger, and bandleader. Born in Cuthbert, Georgia, while later attending Wilberforce University he formed a band called the Collegians, which included Benny Carter and Rex Stewart. This band was later known as the Horace Henderson Orchestra and then as the Dixie Stompers. Henderson left the band to work with Sammy Stewart, then in 1928 organized a new band called the Collegians. Don Redman took over this band in 1931; Henderson continued to work as the band's pianist and arranger before leaving to work for his brother. He arranged for many of the most important jazz musicians of the era, including his brother. Fletcher Henderson's book contained about as many of Horace's arrangements as of Fletcher's. Although Horace worked continually, led bands, arranged, recorded, and composed into the 1980s, and although he is considered by many the more talented and skillful of the Henderson brothers, Fletcher remained more popular and accomplished more in the field. Among his better known clients for arrangements, in addition to his brother, were Charlie Barnet, the Casa Loma Orchestra, Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, Earl Hines, and Jimmie Lunceford. His best known arrangements are of his own \"Hot and Anxious\" which later became \"In The Mood\" and of \"Christopher Columbus\", which he was one of the writers of but never got the credit (both for his brother). He also wrote another popular song of the big band era called \"Big John Special. \" These were three of the defining songs of the period. At different times in his career, Horace was pianist and musical director for both Lena Horne and Billie Holiday."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bix_Beiderbecke> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Leon Bismark \"Bix\" Beiderbecke (March 10, 1903 \u2013 August 6, 1931) was an American jazz cornetist, jazz pianist, and composer. With Louis Armstrong and Muggsy Spanier, Beiderbecke was one of the most influential jazz soloists of the 1920s. His turns on \"Singin' the Blues\" (1927) and \"I'm Coming, Virginia\" (1927), in particular, demonstrated an unusual purity of tone and a gift for improvisation. With these two recordings, especially, he helped to invent the jazz ballad style and hinted at what, in the 1950s, would become cool jazz. \"In a Mist\" (1927), one of a handful of his piano compositions but the only one he recorded, mixed classical influences with jazz syncopation. Beiderbecke also has been credited for his influence, directly, on Bing Crosby and, indirectly, via saxophonist Frank Trumbauer, on Lester Young. A native of Davenport, Iowa, Beiderbecke taught himself to play cornet largely by ear, leading him to adopt a non-standard fingering that some critics have connected to his original sound. He first recorded with a Midwestern jazz ensemble The Wolverines in 1924, after which he played briefly for the Detroit-based Jean Goldkette Orchestra before joining Frankie \"Tram\" Trumbauer for an extended gig at the Arcadia Ballroom in St. Louis, Missouri. Beiderbecke and Trumbauer both joined Goldkette in 1926. The band toured widely and famously played a set opposite Fletcher Henderson at the Roseland Ballroom in New York City in October 1926. The following year, Trumbauer and Beiderbecke left Detroit to join the best-known and most prestigious dance orchestra in the country: the New York-based Paul Whiteman Orchestra. Beiderbecke's most influential recordings date from his time with Goldkette and Whiteman, although they were generally recorded under his own name or Trumbauer's. The Whiteman period also marked a precipitous decline in Beiderbecke's health, brought on by the demand of the bandleader's relentless touring and recording schedule in combination with Beiderbecke's persistent alcoholism. A few stints in rehabilitation centers, as well as the support of Whiteman and the Beiderbecke family in Davenport, did not check Beiderbecke's decline in health. He left the Whiteman band in 1930 and the following summer died in his Queens apartment at the age of 28. His death, in turn, gave rise to one of the original legends of jazz. In magazine articles, musicians' memoirs, novels, and Hollywood films, Beiderbecke has been reincarnated as a Romantic hero, the \"Young Man with a Horn\". His life has been portrayed as a battle against such common obstacles to art as family and commerce, while his death has been seen as a martyrdom for the sake of art. The musician-critic Benny Green sarcastically called Beiderbecke \"jazz's Number One Saint,\" while Ralph Berton compared him to Jesus. The historical Beiderbecke, meanwhile, is the subject of scholarly controversy regarding his true name, the cause of his death, and the importance of his contributions to jazz."@en .

Clooney's career languished in the 1960s, partly due to problems related to depression and drug addiction, but revived in 1977, when her White Christmas co-star Bing Crosby asked her to appear with him at a show marking his 50th anniversary in show business.

Murphy served in the Navy during World War II, during which time he played and recorded when he could, with the likes of Lu Watters and Bunk Johnson. In 1952, he headed his own band, \"Turk Murphy's Jazz Band,\" which included pianist Wally Rose, clarinetist Bob Helm, banjo player Dick Lammi, and tubaist Bob Short. They played at the Italian Village at Columbus and Lombard, in San Francisco\u2019s North Beach. The band appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show twice, in 1959 and 1965. In 1979, horn man Bob Schulz began an eight-year stint with the band. Other notable band members over the years included trumpeters Don Kinch, Bob Short, and Leon Oakley; pianists Pete Clute and Ray Skjelbred; and singer Pat Yankee. Murphy was the singer for the 1971 Sesame Street cartoon shorts, \"The Alligator King\" and \"#9 Martian Beauty\" animated and produced by his long-time friend, animator Bud Luckey. Murphy also arranged and performed on many of Bud Luckey's other Sesame Street animated Shorts. In addition to Luckey, Murphy was a long-time friend of fellow trombonist and Disney animator Ward Kimball who created many memorable caricatures of Murphy and Charles Addams creator of The Addams Family. Among other venues, Murphy's band played his nightclub \"Earthquake McGoons,\" which opened in 1960 and moved three times, from 99 Broadway to 630 Clay in 1964, the Embarcadero in 1979 and Pier 39 in 1983, before closing in 1984. In January 1987, Murphy played Carnegie Hall. He died on May 30, 1987, leaving behind his wife Harriet and their son Carson. He is buried at Cypress Lawn Memorial Park, Colma, San Mateo County, CA. Together with Lu Watters and Bob Scobey, Murphy dominated the revivalism in the San Francisco area. His band recorded and released dozens of albums."@en .

Simone aspired to become a classical pianist while working in a broad range of styles including classical, jazz, blues, folk, R&B, gospel, and pop. Born the sixth child of a preacher's family in North Carolina, Simone aspired to be a concert pianist. Her musical path changed direction after she was denied a scholarship to the prestigious Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, despite a well-received audition. Simone was later told by someone working at Curtis that she was rejected because she was black. When she began playing in a small club in Philadelphia to fund her continuing musical education and become a classical pianist she was required to sing as well. She was approached for a recording by Bethlehem Records, and her rendering of \"I Loves You, Porgy\" was a hit in the United States in 1958. Over the length of her career Simone recorded more than 40 albums, mostly between 1958\u2014when she made her debut with Little Girl Blue\u2014and 1974. Her musical style arose from a fusion of gospel and pop songs with classical music, in particular with influences from her first inspiration, Johann Sebastian Bach, and accompanied with her expressive jazz-like singing in her characteristic contralto. She injected as much of her classical background into her music as possible to give it more depth and quality, as she felt that pop music was inferior to classical. Her intuitive grasp on the audience\u2013performer relationship was gained from a unique background of playing piano accompaniment for church revivals and sermons regularly from the early age of six years old. In the early 1960s, she became involved in the civil rights movement and the direction of her life shifted once again. Simone's music was highly influential in the fight for equal rights in the United States. In later years, she lived abroad, finally settling in France in 1992."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sun_Ra> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Sun Ra (born Herman Poole Blount, legal name Le Sony'r Ra; May 22, 1914 \u2013 May 30, 1993) was a prolific jazz composer, bandleader, piano and synthesizer player, poet and philosopher known for his \"cosmic philosophy,\" musical compositions and performances. He was born in Birmingham, Alabama. He is a 1979 inductee of the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame. \"Of all the jazz musicians, Sun Ra was probably the most controversial,\" critic Scott Yanow said, because of Sun Ra's eclectic music and unorthodox lifestyle. Claiming that he was of the \"Angel Race\" and not from Earth, but from Saturn, Sun Ra developed a complex persona using \"cosmic\" philosophies and lyrical poetry that made him a pioneer of afrofuturism. He preached awareness and peace above all. He abandoned his birth name and took on the name and persona of Sun Ra (Ra being the Egyptian God of the Sun), and used several other names throughout his career, including Le Sonra and Sonny Lee. Sun Ra denied any connection with his birth name, saying \"That's an imaginary person, never existed \u2026 Any name that I use other than Ra is a pseudonym. \" From the mid-1950s to his death, Sun Ra led \"The Arkestra\" (a deliberate re-spelling of \"orchestra\"), an ensemble with an ever-changing lineup and name. It was by turns called \"The Solar Myth Arkestra\", \"His Cosmo Discipline Arkestra\", the \"Blue Universe Arkestra\", \"The Jet Set Omniverse Arkestra\", and many other variations. Sun Ra asserted that the ever-changing name of his ensemble reflected the ever-changing nature of his music. His mainstream success was limited, but Sun Ra was a prolific recording artist and frequent live performer. His music ranged from keyboard solos to big bands of over 30 musicians and touched on virtually the entire history of jazz, from ragtime to swing music, from bebop to free jazz. He was also a pioneer of electronic music and space music. He also used free improvisation and was one of the first musicians, of any genre, to make extensive use of electronic keyboards."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_Jordan> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Louis Thomas Jordan (July 8, 1908 \u2013 February 4, 1975) was a pioneering American musician, songwriter and bandleader who enjoyed his greatest popularity from the late 1930s to the early 1950s. Known as \"The King of the Jukebox\", he was highly popular with both black and white audiences in the later years of the swing era. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked him no. 59 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Jordan was one of the most successful African-American musicians of the 20th century, ranking fifth in the list of the all-time most successful black recording artists according to Billboard magazine's chart methodology. Though comprehensive sales figures are not available, he scored at least four million-selling hits during his career. Jordan regularly topped the R&B \"race\" charts, and was one of the first black recording artists to achieve a significant \"crossover\" in popularity into the mainstream (predominantly white) American audience, scoring simultaneous Top Ten hits on the white pop charts on several occasions. After Duke Ellington and Count Basie, Louis Jordan was probably the most popular and successful African-American bandleader of his day. Jordan was a talented singer with great comedic flair, and he fronted his own band for more than twenty years. He duetted with some of the biggest solo singing stars of his day, including Bing Crosby, Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong. Jordan was also an actor and a major black film personality\u2014he appeared in dozens of \"soundies\" (promotional film clips), made numerous cameos in mainstream features and short films, and starred in two musical feature films made especially for him. He was an instrumentalist who specialized in the alto saxophone but played all forms of the instrument, as well as piano and clarinet. A productive songwriter, he wrote or co-wrote many songs that became influential classics of 20th-century popular music. Although Jordan began his career in big-band swing jazz in the 1930s, he became famous as one of the leading practitioners, innovators and popularizers of \"jump blues\", a swinging, up-tempo, dance-oriented hybrid of jazz, blues and boogie-woogie. Typically performed by smaller bands consisting of five or six players, jump music featured shouted, highly syncopated vocals and earthy, comedic lyrics on contemporary urban themes. It strongly emphasized the rhythm section of piano, bass and drums; after the mid-1940s, this mix was often augmented by electric guitar. Jordan's band also pioneered the use of electric organ. With his dynamic Tympany Five bands, Jordan mapped out the main parameters of the classic R&B, urban blues and early rock'n'roll genres with a series of hugely influential 78 rpm discs for the Decca label. These recordings presaged many of the styles of black popular music in the late 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, and exerted a huge influence on many leading performers in these genres. Many of his records were produced by Milt Gabler, who went on to refine and develop the qualities of Jordan's recordings in his later production work with Bill Haley, including \"Rock Around The Clock\"."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fate_Marable> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Fate Marable (2 December 1890 \u2013 16 January 1947) was a jazz pianist and bandleader. Marable was born in Paducah, Kentucky, and learned piano from his mother. At age 17, he began playing on the steam boats plying the Mississippi River. He soon became bandleader for boats on the Streckfus Line, which ran several paddlewheelers which held dances and excursions along the river from New Orleans, Louisiana to Minneapolis, Minnesota. Marable appreciated the new \"jazz\" sound being played by the New Orleans musicians, and the bulk of his band members were recruited from that city. Members of Marable's bands were expected to be able to play a wide variety of music, from hot numbers to light classics, both play by head and from sheet music, and above all to keep the dancers happy. Marable was a strict bandleader, demanding musical proficiency and rigid discipline from all his bandmembers, yet allowing them to develop their individual strong points. For instance, Louis Armstrong's gift for improvisation was recognised as such by Marable, and he allowed him to improvise his breaks rather than play them note for note. Marable's band served as an early musical education for many other players who would later become prominent in jazz, including Red Allen, Baby Dodds, Johnny Dodds, Pops Foster, Narvin Kimball, Al Morgan and Zutty Singleton. In addition to piano and bandleading, Marable played the boats' steam calliope, a contraption that could be heard for miles up and down the river and poured down so much water from condensing steam that Marable performed wearing a raincoat and hood. Fate Marable died of pneumonia in St. Louis, Missouri. He was 56 years old. He is buried in Oak Grove Cemetery in Paducah, Ky. A young George Russell, later notable for formulating the Lydian Concept, grew up listening to Marable's music. Fate was a relative of the drummer Larance Marable."@en .

He published his first song, \"Marie from Sunny Italy\", in 1907 and had his first major international hit, \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" in 1911. \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" sparked an international dance craze in places as far away as Berlin's native Russia, which also \"flung itself into the ragtime beat with an abandon bordering on mania. \" Over the years he was known for writing music and lyrics in the American vernacular: uncomplicated, simple and direct, with his aim being to \"reach the heart of the average American\" whom he saw as the \"real soul of the country. \" He wrote hundreds of songs, many becoming major hits, which made him \"a legend\" before he turned thirty. During his 60-year career he wrote an estimated 1,500 songs, including the scores for 19 Broadway shows and 18 Hollywood films, with his songs nominated eight times for Academy Awards. Many songs became popular themes and anthems, including \"Easter Parade\", \"White Christmas\", \"Happy Holiday\", \"This is the Army, Mr. Jones\", and \"There's No Business Like Show Business\". His Broadway musical and 1942 film, This is the Army, with Ronald Reagan, had Kate Smith singing Berlin's \"God Bless America\" which was first performed in 1938. Smith still performed the song on her 1960 CBS television series, The Kate Smith Show. After the September 11 attacks in 2001, Celine Dion recorded it as a tribute, making it #1 on the charts. Berlin's songs have reached the top of the charts 25 times and have been extensively re-recorded by numerous singers including Fred Astaire, Ethel Merman, Frank Sinatra, Ethel Waters, Judy Garland, Barbra Streisand, Linda Ronstadt, Rosemary Clooney, Cher, Diana Ross, Bing Crosby, Rita Reys, Frankie Laine, Johnnie Ray, Al Jolson, Nat King Cole, Billie Holiday, Doris Day and Ella Fitzgerald. Composer Douglas Moore sets Berlin apart from all other contemporary songwriters, and includes him instead with Stephen Foster, Walt Whitman, and Carl Sandburg, as a \"great American minstrel\"\u2014someone who has \"caught and immortalized in his songs what we say, what we think about, and what we believe. \" Composer George Gershwin called him \"the greatest songwriter that has ever lived\", and composer Jerome Kern concluded that \"Irving Berlin has no place in American music\u2014he is American music.\""@en .

Beginning his musical career in the swing era with Harry James and Tommy Dorsey, Sinatra found unprecedented success as a solo artist from the early to mid-1940s after being signed to Columbia Records in 1943. Being the idol of the \"bobby soxers\", he released his first album, The Voice of Frank Sinatra in 1946. His professional career had stalled by the 1950s, but it was reborn in 1953 after he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in From Here to Eternity. He signed with Capitol Records in 1953 and released several critically lauded albums. Sinatra left Capitol to found his own record label, Reprise Records in 1961, toured internationally, was a founding member of the Rat Pack and fraternized with celebrities and statesmen, including John F. Kennedy. Sinatra turned 50 in 1965, recorded the retrospective September of My Years, starred in the Emmy-winning television special Frank Sinatra: A Man and His Music, and scored hits with \"Strangers in the Night\" and \"My Way\". With sales of his music dwindling and after appearing in several poorly received films, Sinatra retired for the first time in 1971. Two years later, however, he came out of retirement and in 1973 recorded several albums, scoring a Top 40 hit with \"(Theme From) New York, New York\" in 1980. Using his Las Vegas shows as a home base, he toured both within the United States and internationally, until a short time before his death in 1998. Sinatra also forged a highly successful career as a film actor. After winning Best Supporting Actor in 1953, he also garnered a nomination for Best Actor for The Man with the Golden Arm, and critical acclaim for his performance in The Manchurian Candidate. He also starred in such musicals as High Society, Pal Joey, Guys and Dolls and On the Town. Sinatra was honored at the Kennedy Center Honors in 1983 and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Ronald Reagan in 1985 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1997. Sinatra was also the recipient of eleven Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Trustees Award, Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award."@en .

Reed was a major player in the field of electric blues, as opposed to the more acoustic-based sound of many of his contemporaries. His lazy, slack-jawed singing, piercing harmonica and hypnotic guitar patterns were one of the blues' most easily identifiable sounds in the 1950s and 1960s, and had a significant impact on many rock and roll artists who followed, such as Elvis Presley, Billy Gibbons and the Rolling Stones."@en .

He appeared in his first film in 1937, and the same year appeared in the film Hollywood Hotel, where he introduced the Johnny Mercer song \"Hooray for Hollywood\". His lively rendition became popular and became closely associated with the film industry. He appeared in fifteen films including \"Campus Cinderella\" (1938), Cowboy from Brooklyn (1938), Brother Rat (1938), A Child is Born (1939) and Sarong Girl (1943).

Ellington was born in Washington, DC, the son of famous composer, pianist, and bandleader Duke Ellington and Edna Thompson. By the age of eighteen he had written his first piece to be recorded by his father (\"Pigeons and Peppers\"). In 1939, 1946\u20131949, and 1959 he led his own bands, many of whose members went on to play with his father, or to achieve independent fame. During the 1940s in particular he wrote pieces that became standards, including \"Things Ain't What They Used to Be\", \"Jumpin' Punkins\", \"Moon Mist\", and \"Blue Serge\". He also wrote the lyrics to Hillis Walters' popular song, \"Pass Me By\" (1946), which was recorded by Lena Horne, Carmen McRae and Peggy Lee. He composed for his father from 1940 to 1941, worked as road manager for Cootie Williams' orchestra (1941 to 1943 and again in 1954), and returned to work for his father playing E-flat horn in 1950, and then as general manager and copyist from 1955 to 1959. In 1960 he became Della Reese's musical director, then in 1962 went on take a job as a radio DJ in New York for three years. In 1965 he again returned to his father's orchestra, this time as trumpeter and road manager. When his father died in 1974, Ellington took over the orchestra, taking it on tour to Europe in 1975 and 1977 (his own son, Edward Ellington, played in the band in the late 1970s, and his other son, Paul Mercer Ellington, took it over at a later date). Ellington also has a daughter Mercedes Ellington. In the early 1980s Ellington became the first conductor for a Broadway musical of his father's music, Sophisticated Ladies. Before his death the Duke Ellington Orchestra included Barrie Lee Hall, Rocky White, Tommy James, Gregory Charles Royal, J.J. Wiggins, and Shelly Carrol among others. Mercer Ellington performed up to the day of his passing. Ellington died of a heart attack a month short of his seventy-seventh birthday.

Born in Benton Harbor, Michigan, the son of a bass player in a touring dance band, he spent his early years traveling with his parents; his mother said, \"He was on the road when he was only a few months old; he slept in the bass case under the bandstand. \" From the age of five, he took piano lessons in South Bend, Indiana, his parents' home base; later, in high school in Cincinnati, he switched to the trumpet, which he played in a Midwest band led by Don Strickland before serving for four years in the Air Force. He studied at the Cincinnati College of Music and Berklee College of Music in Boston and played trumpet with the Woody Herman and Maynard Ferguson orchestras before joining the Ellington orchestra in 1961 as one of its first white members. After his stint with Ellington, he played with the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis Jazz Orchestra and led his own big band in New York; in 1965 he joined The Merv Griffin Show, where he remained for fifteen years, moving to Los Angeles with Griffin and reforming his group as the L.A. Big Band in 1971. Jack Nimitz, a baritone saxophonist in his band, said \"He knew how to get what he wanted out of the band in a very relaxed way \u2014 nice and easy, no shouting. \" Among the most successful of his own recordings was Shortcake (Concord, 1978), an album of jazz for small group in the Ellington style; he appeared on many albums by other musicians, including Rosemary Clooney (Everything's Coming Up Rosie), Scott Hamilton (Scott Hamilton Is a Good Wind Who Is Blowing Us No Ill), Jake Hanna (Live at Concord), and Coleman Hawkins (Wrapped Tight)."@en .

In addition to Charles' piano/bass, the group contains a guitar, drums, and a three-piece horn section.

His improvisational style was characterized by the use of wide intervals, in addition to using an array of extended techniques to reproduce human- and animal-like effects which almost literally made his instruments speak. Although Dolphy's work is sometimes classified as free jazz, his compositions and solos were often rooted in conventional (if highly abstracted) tonal bebop harmony and melodic lines that suggest the influences of modern classical composers B\u00E9la Bart\u00F3k and Igor Stravinsky."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aretha_Franklin> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Aretha Louise Franklin (born March 25, 1942) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and pianist. In a recording career that has spanned over half a century, Franklin's repertoire has included gospel, jazz, blues, R&B, pop, rock and funk. Franklin is known as one of the most important popularizers of the soul music genre and is referred to as the Queen of Soul, a title she was given early in her career. Franklin, the daughter of prominent Baptist minister and activist C. L. Franklin, began her singing career singing in her father's church at the age of ten and started recording four years later. After several years in the gospel circuit and with her father's blessing, she formed a secular pop music career at the age of eighteen, signing with Columbia Records, where she was branded by its CEO John Hammond as his most important act since Billie Holiday. Franklin's Columbia period wasn't as successful as hoped and in late 1966, Franklin switched over to Atlantic Records, where she began recording a string of popular hits including \"I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)\", \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\", \"Think\", \"Chain of Fools\" and what later became her signature song, \"Respect\". After she broke her leg; a brief lull in 1969, Franklin continued to record a string of popular singles throughout the early 1970s, reaching her peak as an albums artist with 1970's Spirit in the Dark, 1971's Young, Gifted & Black and the 1972 gospel record, Amazing Grace, which became the best-selling pure gospel album of all time. Franklin's success in Atlantic peaked after the release of the singles, \"Until You Come Back to Me (That's What I'm Gonna Do)\", \"I'm in Love\" and \"Giving Him Something He Can Feel\" and the 1976 soundtrack to the movie, Sparkle and Franklin left the label in 1980 to sign with Clive Davis' Arista Records label where she switched over from soul and funk music to a more conservative urban adult contemporary sound in the albums, Aretha and Love All the Hurt Away, before regaining commercial success with the 1982 Gold album, Jump to It, produced by R&B hitmaker Luther Vandross. In 1984, Franklin added modern day pop rock and dance elements to her sound, which was integral to the success of her 1985 Platinum album, Who's Zoomin' Who?, which spawned the hits \"Freeway of Love\", \"Who's Zoomin' Who\" and the Eurythmics members Annie Lennox and David A. Stewart featured \"Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves\". The 1986 release, Aretha, featured her seventeenth Top 10 single - a #1 duet with George Michael entitled \"I Knew You Were Waiting for Me\". Afterwards Aretha did not return to the Gold standard until the release of 1998's A Rose Is Still a Rose, which incorporated modern day contemporary R&B and which the title track returned Franklin to the top 40 of the pop charts. Rolling Stone magazine ranked her atop its \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time\" list, as well as the ninth greatest artist of all time. She has won a total of 20 career Grammy Awards, including two honorary Grammys, and she is one of the best-selling female artists of all time, having sold over 75 million records worldwide. In 1987, Franklin became the first female artist to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. On August 14, 2012, Franklin was inducted into the GMA Gospel Music Hall of Fame."@en .

Christian was an important early performer on the electric guitar, and is cited as a key figure in the development of bebop and cool jazz. He gained national exposure as a member of the Benny Goodman Sextet and Orchestra from August 1939 to June 1941. His single-string technique combined with amplification helped bring the guitar out of the rhythm section and into the forefront as a solo instrument. John Hammond and George T. Simon called Christian the best improvisational talent of the swing era. In the liner notes to the 1972 Columbia album Solo Flight: The Genius of Charlie Christian, Gene Lees writes that \"many critics and musicians consider that Christian was one of the founding fathers of bebop, or if not that, at least a precursor to it\". Christian's influence reached beyond jazz and swing \u2014 in 1990 he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Christian was raised in Oklahoma City and was one of many musicians who jammed along the city's \"Deep Deuce\" section on N.E. Second Street. In 2006 Oklahoma City renamed a street in its Bricktown entertainment district \"Charlie Christian Avenue\"."@en .

Born Barbara Jean McNair in Chicago, Illinois and raised in Racine, Wisconsin, McNair studied music at the American Conservatory of Music in Chicago. Her big break came with a win on Arthur Godfrey's TV show Talent Scouts, which led to bookings at The Purple Onion and the Cocoanut Grove. She soon became one of the country's most popular headliners and a guest on such television variety shows as The Steve Allen Show, Hullabaloo, The Bell Telephone Hour, and The Hollywood Palace, while recording for the Coral, Signature, Motown, and TEC Recording Studios labels. Among her hits were \"You're Gonna Love My Baby\" and \"Bobby\". In the early 1960s, McNair made several musical shorts for Scopitone, a franchise of coin-operated machines that showed what were the forerunners of today's music videos. In 1967 McNair traveled with Bob Hope to Southeast Asia to perform for U.S. troops during the Vietnam War along with Raquel Welch, Elaine Dunn, Phil Crosby and 1967 Miss World Madeleine Hartog Bell. She said on stage that Hope talked her into going on the tour by promising her she'd get to meet royalty. \"He let me walk his dog Prince,\" she joked. Among the songs she sang was an slowed-down, emotional version of \"For Once in My Life. \" McNair's acting career began on television, guesting on series such as Dr. Kildare, The Eleventh Hour, I Spy, Mission: Impossible, Hogan's Heroes and McMillan and Wife. McNair posed nude for Playboy in the October 1968 issue. She caught the attention of the movie-going public with her much-publicized nude sequences in the gritty crime drama If He Hollers Let Him Go (1968) opposite Raymond St. Jacques, then donned a nun's habit alongside Mary Tyler Moore for Change of Habit (1969), Elvis Presley's last feature film. She portrayed Sidney Poitier's wife in They Call Me MISTER Tibbs! (1970) and its sequel, The Organization (1971), and George Jefferson's deranged ex-girlfriend Yvonne in The Jeffersons (1984). McNair's Broadway credits include The Body Beautiful (1958), No Strings (1962), and a revival of The Pajama Game (1973). McNair starred in her own 1969 television variety series The Barbara McNair Show, one of the first black women to host her own musical variety show. The show, which was produced in Canada by CTV lasted three seasons in first-run syndication in the United States until 1972, at the time she married Frederick Andrew Manzie (Rick Manzie), Mr. Manzie managed Barbara McNair and produced the show with Burt Rosen, they formed ABR Entertainment and the rights to the show are owned by the Manzie Family. The show starred A-list guests like Tony Bennett, Sonny and Cher, The Righteous Brothers, Johnny Mathis, Freda Payne, and many more entertainers that became superstars. On December 15, 1976, her husband, Rick Manzie, was murderedhttp://news. google. com/newspapers?id=9To0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=cesFAAAAIBAJ&pg=940%2C2107694, in their Las Vegas Bruce Street Mansion and Mafia boss-turned-FBI-informant Jimmy Fratianno later claimed in his book The Last Mafioso that Manzie had been a Mafia associate who tried to put a contract on the life of a mob-associated tax attorney with whom he had a legal dispute. \"Many believe the murder was a mafia hit, although this has never been officially proven\"http://bobmillerwrites. com/BarbaraMcNair. htm. The ensuing publicity did little to help McNair's career. Her recordings include Livin' End, \"The Real Barbara McNair\", More Today Than Yesterday\", Broadway Show Stoppers\", \"A Movie Soundtrack If He Hollars, Let Him Go\", I Enjoy Being a Girl, and The Ultimate Motown Collection, a two-CD set with 48 tracks that include her two albums for the label plus a non-album single and B-side and an entire LP that never was released. Into her seventies, McNair resided in the Los Angeles area, playing tennis and skiing to keep in shape on a regular basis and touring on occasion. She died on February 4, 2007, of throat cancer, in Los Angeles, survived by her husband Charles Blecka, sister Jaquline Gaither, niece Angela Rosenow, and the nephew of her late husband Frederick Manzie, John Thomas and his family."@en .

He is considered to be one of the pioneers and founders of soul music. He is commonly known as the King of Soul for his distinctive vocal abilities and influence on the modern world of music. His contribution in pioneering soul music led to the rise of Aretha Franklin, Bobby Womack, Al Green, Curtis Mayfield, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, and popularized the likes of Otis Redding and James Brown. Cooke had 30 U.S. top 40 hits between 1957 and 1964, and a further three after his death. Major hits like \"You Send Me\", \"A Change Is Gonna Come\", \"Cupid\", \"Chain Gang\", \"Wonderful World\", and \"Twistin' the Night Away\" are some of his most popular songs. Cooke was also among the first modern black performers and composers to attend to the business side of his musical career. He founded both a record label and a publishing company as an extension of his careers as a singer and composer. He also took an active part in the American Civil Rights Movement. On December 11, 1964, Cooke was fatally shot by the manager of the Hacienda Motel in Los Angeles, California, at the age of 33. At the time, the courts ruled that Cooke was drunk and distressed, and that the manager had killed Cooke in what was later ruled a justifiable homicide. Since that time, the circumstances of his death have been widely questioned."@en .

He freelanced during the 1960s with many bands and in the 1970s he started recording for Harry Lim under the Famous Door record label. He was a great well schooled drummer able to swing any band he performed with. Buddy Rich and Mousey were friends and Buddy thought highly of his playing. Mousey had a bad stroke in 1980 but fully recovered over time, and played up until his death in 1988. He died of heart and kidney failure."@en .

He wrote \"You Came a Long Way from St. Louis\" with Bob Russell for Ray McKinley in 1948. In 1956 Brooks worked with Zoot Sims and Al Cohn on a recording \"Folk Jazz U.S.A. \" He became better-known as a composer during this time, and his works blend elements of folk music and dodecaphony with the idioms of modern jazz. In 1958 he composed a work entitled Alabama Concerto and assembled a cast of sidemen for a recording which included Cannonball Adderley, Art Farmer, Barry Galbraith, and Milt Hinton. The recording was eventually re-issued under Adderley's name. Brooks was a close friend of Gil Evans. Evans later recorded his works \"Sirhan's Blues\" and \"Where Flamingos Fly\". Brooks and Courlander collaborated on a book of transcriptions of rural blues and spirituals in Alabama, which provided some of the inspiration for the Alabama Concerto. A trio Brooks formed In the 1960s performed at the International Jazz Festival in Washington in 1962 with a composition called \"The Twelves,\" based on improvisations on twelve-tone rows. This became part of a LP called \"Avant Slant,\" which was a collage of new and already recorded sounds and songs from Milt Gabler, the poet Robert Graves, LeRoi Jones, Lightnin' Hopkins, and others."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jelly_Roll_Morton> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Ferdinand Joseph LaMothe (October 20, 1890\u00A0\u2013 July 10, 1941), known professionally as Jelly Roll Morton, was an American ragtime and early jazz pianist, bandleader and composer who started his career in New Orleans, Louisiana. Widely recognized as a pivotal figure in early jazz, Morton is perhaps most notable as jazz's first arranger, proving that a genre rooted in improvisation could retain its essential spirit and characteristics when notated. His composition \"Jelly Roll Blues\" was the first published jazz composition, in 1915. Morton is also notable for naming and popularizing the \"Spanish tinge\", and for writing such standards as \"Wolverine Blues\", \"Black Bottom Stomp\", and \"I Thought I Heard Buddy Bolden Say\", the latter a tribute to New Orleans personalities from the turn of the 19th century to 20th century. Reputed for his arrogance and self-promotion as often as recognized in his day for his musical talents, Morton claimed to have invented jazz outright in 1902\u00A0\u2014 much to the derision of later musicians and critics. The jazz historian, musician, and composer Gunther Schuller says of Morton's \"hyperbolic assertions\" that there is \"no proof to the contrary\" and that Morton's \"considerable accomplishments in themselves provide reasonable substantiation\". However, the scholar Katy Martin has argued that Morton's bragging was exaggerated by Alan Lomax in the book Mister Jelly Roll, and this portrayal has influenced public opinion and scholarship on Morton since."@en .

After serving in World War II he toured with Earl Bostic in the late 1940s, and, by then based in Boston, made his recording debut with Charlie Mariano in 1951. Later, he was a member of the bands of Herb Pomeroy (1952\u201355, recording in 1957) and Maynard Ferguson (1959\u201362). Moving to New York, Byard recorded extensively with Charles Mingus in the periods 1962 to 1964 and 1970, touring Europe with him in 1964. He also made important recordings as a sideman with Eric Dolphy, Booker Ervin and Sam Rivers. As a leader, he recorded a string of albums for the Prestige label during the 1960s. He fronted an occasional big band, the Apollo Stompers. He taught at the New England Conservatory, Manhattan School of Music, Hartt School of Music and the New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Freddie_Keppard> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Freddie Keppard (sometimes rendered as Freddy Keppard) (February 27, 1889 \u2013 July 15, 1933) was an early jazz cornetist. Keppard was born in the Creole of Color community of downtown New Orleans, Louisiana. His older brother Louis Keppard was also a professional musician. Freddie played violin, mandolin, and accordion before switching to cornet. After playing with the Olympia Orchestra he joined Frankie Dusen's Eagle Band, taking the place recently vacated by Buddy Bolden. Soon after Bolden was off the music scene Keppard was proclaimed \"King Keppard\" as the city's top horn player. About 1914 Joe \"King\" Oliver won a musical \"cutting contest\" and claimed Keppard's crown; soon after Keppard accepted an offer to join Bill Johnson's band in Los Angeles, California. Johnson and Keppard's band became the Original Creole Orchestra which toured the Vaudeville circuit, giving other parts of the USA a first taste of the music that was not yet known as \"jazz\". While playing a successful engagement in New York City in 1915 the band was offered a chance to record for the Victor Talking Machine Company. In retrospect this would probably have been the first jazz recording. An often repeated story says that Keppard didn't want to record because then everyone else could \"steal his stuff. \" Another well known story is that he was so paranoid about the risk of being copied that he sometimes played with a handkerchief over his fingers to conceal how he played. The recording company offered him $25 flat fee to make a record (a fairly standard rate for non-star performers at the time), far less than he was earning on the vaudeville circuit. His retort to this offer, according to Lawrence Gushee's research, was: \"Twenty-Five dollars? I drink that much gin in a day!\" The reminiscences of the other members of the Creole Orchestra reveal that another factor was that the Victor representative had asked them to make a \"test recording\" without pay, and the band balked, fearing it was a ploy to have them make records without being paid. About 1917 Keppard settled in Chicago, which would remain his home (except for briefly going to the East Coast to work with Tim Brymn's band about 1920). Keppard worked in Chicago both as a soloist and with the bands of Jimmie Noone, Johnny Dodds, Erskine Tate, Doc Cook (for several years), Don Pasquall, and Lil Hardin Armstrong. Keppard made all his known recordings in Chicago from 1924 to 1927. The only recordings he is certainly on are three sides under his own name (\"Freddie Keppard's Jazz Cardinals\") and a dozen with Doc Cooke's Orchestra, most of which are wonderfully arranged and with Keppard on second cornet. Note that second cornet was the logical and quite demanding seat for the premier cornetist in a two-cornet band, as evidenced by Louis Armstrong's role (one example of many) in similar sized bands and orchestras around the same period. His \"Stockyard Strut\" is in fact a stunning improvisation on the chords of \"Tiger Rag\". Aficionados will derive great pleasure from his contributions to the Doc Coooke recordings, wherein he plays the 'walking-talking' style of Stomp Cornet that pre-dates jazz by about a half generation and follows naturally from ragtime by the same margin. There are a few other recordings on which he plausibly may appear, and a great many more that are often dubiously attributed to him. Keppard was widely imitated both in New Orleans and Chicago, including contemporaneous and highly regarded players such as Louis Panico and Frank Guarante. Many of his contemporaries said that either Keppard was past his prime when he recorded or that his recordings do not do him justice. Nonetheless, informed listening to the sides on which he is undoubtedly present reveal Keppard to be technically a very proficient player and an adventurous improviser. Many make the mistake of comparing his accomplishments to jazz of a later era, a comparison which does neither approach any favours. Keppard's style is much more raggy compared to Oliver's blues tinged style. While Oliver had more admirers, to some extent preference was a matter of taste; Jelly Roll Morton, Lil Hardin Armstrong, and Wellman Braud all thought Keppard superior to Oliver. Several musicians with clear memories of Buddy Bolden said that Freddie Keppard sounded the most like Bolden of anyone who recorded. Keppard suffered from alcoholism and tuberculosis in his final years, and died, largely forgotten, in Chicago."@en .

Lacy also became a highly distinctive composer with a signature organic of style, with compositions often built out of little more than a single questioning phrase, repeated several times. The music of Thelonious Monk became a permanent part of Lacy's repertoire after a stint in the pianist's band, with Monk's songs appearing on virtually every Lacy album and concert program; Lacy often partnered with trombonist Roswell Rudd in exploring Monk's work.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jerry_Lee_Lewis> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Jerry Lee Lewis (born September 29, 1935) is an American rock and roll singer-songwriter and pianist. He is known by the nickname \"The Killer\" and is often viewed as \u201Crock & roll's first great wild man\u201D. An early pioneer of rock and roll music, in 1956 Lewis made his first recordings at Sun Records. \"Crazy Arms\" sold 300,000 copies in the South, but it was his 1957 hit \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On\" that shot Lewis to fame worldwide. Lewis followed this in that same year when he recorded songs such as \"Great Balls of Fire\", \"Breathless\" and \"High School Confidential\". Lewis sold more records than Elvis Presley at this time. However, Lewis' rock 'n' roll career faltered in the wake of his marriage to his young cousin. He had little success in the charts following the scandal and his popularity quickly faded. His live performance fee\u2019s plummeted from $10,000 per night to $250. In the meantime he was determined to gain back some of his popularity. During the early 60\u2019s he didn't have much chart success with few exceptions such as \"What'd I Say\". His live performances at this time were increasingly wild and energetic. His album Live at the Star Club, Hamburg from 1964 is often regarded by many music journalists and fans as one of the wildest and greatest rock and roll concert albums ever. After recording songs such as \"I'm on Fire\" for several years with little success, in 1968 Lewis made a transition into country music and had hits with songs such as \"Another Place, Another Time\". This reignited his career and throughout the late '60s and '70s he regularly topped the country-western charts. His #1 country hits included \"To Make Love Sweeter For You\", \"There Must Be More to Love Than This\", \"Would You Take Another Chance on Me\" and \"Me And Bobby McGee\". Lewis's successes continued throughout the decade and he embraced his rock 'n' roll past with songs such as a cover of the Big Bopper's \"Chantilly Lace\" and \"Rockin' My Life Away\". In the 21st century Lewis continues to tour to audiences around the world and still releases new albums. One such album, titled Last Man Standing, is his best selling to date at over a million copies sold worldwide. This was followed by Mean Old Man which has received some of the best sales of Lewis\u2019s career. Lewis has had a dozen gold records in both rock and country, won several Grammy awards, including a Lifetime Achievement Award. Lewis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986, and his pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. In 1989, his life was chronicled in the movie Great Balls of Fire, starring Dennis Quaid. In 2003, Rolling Stone Magazine listed his box set All Killer, No Filler: The Anthology number 242 on their list of \"500 greatest albums of all time\". In 2004, they ranked him number 24 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Lewis is the last surviving member of Sun Records' Million Dollar Quartet and the Class of '55 album, which also included Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison and Elvis Presley."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Randy_Sandke> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Randy Sandke (born 1949 in Chicago) is a jazz trumpeter and guitarist. In an interview with Larry Kart he said: \"I got into jazz kind of chronologically, beginning with Bix and Louis, then Dizzy, Clifford Brown, Miles, and Freddie Hubbard. I also studied at Roosevelt University with Renold Schilke, a legendary teacher and maker of trumpets who was with the Chicago Symphony for years\". His high-school band included future luminaries Ray Anderson and George Lewis; when he went to Indiana University, he met Michael Brecker and formed a jazz-rock band. He was offered a job with Janis Joplin, but a hernia of the throat had by then made it impossible for him to play. He spent the 1970s playing guitar in New York, until he was encouraged by a trumpeter friend to take up his original instrument again. He became associated with the traditional jazz scene, working with Vince Giordano and Bob Wilber; it was Wilber who got him a job with Benny Goodman, which lasted from 1984 until Goodman's death in 1986. Sandke has remained strongly associated with swing music, and he is an authority on the music of Louis Armstrong and Bix Beiderbecke. He is a member of the Bix Beiderbecke Memorial society. http://www. bixsociety. org/. In the Kart interview he states: ... if you grow up playing nothing but modern jazz and shift to a more traditional style, you have to dispense with a lot of your favorite harmonic and rhythmic tricks. Instead the interest has to come from somewhere else \u2013 from melody, phrasing, the sheer sound of your instrument. But I believe that those are virtues that can be applied to any style \u2013 traditional or modern \u2013 and that when you do it, you end up with better music. His own interests and musical activities range much more widely, however. He remarks in the liner notes to The Subway Ballet: \"Okay \u2013 I worked with Benny Goodman, but so did Fats Navarro and Herbie Hancock and nobody refers to them as 'swing musicians. ' ... Being thus labeled is somewhat akin to being called a child molester in that the tag never seems to go away, and both can be equally deleterious to one's career. \" He has recorded over twenty albums as a leader, ranging from revisitings of music from the 1920s and 1930s to explorations of contemporary idioms in the company of players like Michael Brecker, Kenny Barron, Marty Ehrlich, Bill Charlap and Uri Caine. He has increasingly become interested in exploring dissonant, nonstandard harmonies that lie outside of conventional triadic harmony, creating a musical theory of what he calls \"metatonality\", a harmonic system outlined in his book Harmony for a New Millennium. His recent projects have included Trumpet After Dark (a jazz-with-strings album that uses Renaissance viols instead of modern violins) and a pair of albums, Inside Out and Outside In, that feature a lineup uniting \"mainstreamers\" such as Ken Peplowski with \"avant-gardists\" such as Ray Anderson and Uri Caine. Sandke's film soundtrack work includes contributions to Coppola's The Cotton Club and several Woody Allen movies, including Bullets Over Broadway. He also played one of the \"Rainbow Room All-Stars\" in The Curse of the Jade Scorpion."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tony_Jackson_(pianist)> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Anthony (Antonio) Jackson, best known as Tony Jackson (June 5, 1876 - April 20, 1921) was an American pianist, singer, and composer. Jackson was born to a poor African American family in Uptown New Orleans, Louisiana on June 5, 1876. He showed musical talents at a young age. At about the age of 10 he constructed a type of crude but working and properly tuned harpsichord out of junk in his back yard, since his family lacked the money to buy or rent a piano. On this contraption young Tony was able to reproduce hymns he heard in church; news of this accomplishment soon spread around the neighborhood and he was offered use of neighbors' pianos and reed organs to practice on. Jackson got his first musical job at age 13, when he began playing piano during off hours at a Tonk run by bandleader Adam Olivier. By age 15 was already considered by many musicians the best pianist in town. Jackson became the most popular and sought after entertainer in Storyville. He was said to be able to remember and play any tune he had heard once, and was hardly ever stumped by obscure requests. His repertory included ragtime, cakewalks (one of his show stopping tricks was to dance a high kicking cakewalk while playing the piano), popular songs of the day from the United States and various nations of Europe and Latin America, blues, and light classics. His singing voice was also exceptional, and he was said to be able to sing operatic parts from baritone to soprano range. Fellow musicians and singers were universal in their praise of Jackson, most calling him \"the greatest\", and even the far-from-modest Jelly Roll Morton ranked Jackson as the only musician better than Morton himself. Jackson also wrote many original tunes, a number of which he sold rights to for a few dollars or were simply stolen from him; some of the old time New Orleans musicians said that some well known Tin Pan Alley pop tunes of the era were actually written by Jackson. Clarence Williams noted \"He was great because he was original in all his improvisations . . . We all copied him. \" More than Jackson's music was copied. Jackson dressed himself with a pearl gray derby, checkered vest, ascot tie with a diamond stickpin, with sleeve garters on his arms to hold up his cuffs as he played. This became a standard outfit for ragtime and barrelhouse pianists; as one commented \"If you can't play like Tony Jackson, at least you can look like him\". Jackson moved to Chicago in 1912. One of the few tunes published with Jackson's name on it, \"Pretty Baby\" came out in 1916, although he was remembered performing the song before he left New Orleans. The original lyrics of \"Pretty Baby\" were said to refer to his male lover of the time. Jackson was resident performer at the De Luxe and Pekin Cafes in Chicago, although in his later years his voice and dexterity were impaired by disease, probably syphilis. He died in Chicago on April 20, 1921. Jackson never recorded, but portions of his style are no doubt to be found in the recordings of younger musicians he influenced, like Jelly Roll Morton, Clarence Williams, and Steve Lewis. In September 2011, The Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame announced that Jackson will be inducted into the hall in a ceremony on November 9. Jackson is being honored for his musical contributions and for living \"as an openly gay man when that was rare\"."@en .

Bright played piano from a very young age, and won a piano competition when he was nine years old. In 1944, he played with the Chicago Youth Piano Symphony Orchestra. He studied at Juilliard, graduating early in the 1950s. Moving back to Chicago, he played with Johnny Tate and accompanied Carmen McRae before relocating to New York City in 1955. There he played with Rolf Kuhn and put together his own trio in 1957. In 1957-58 he was with Dizzy Gillespie, and acted as an accompanist for Sarah Vaughan, Lena Horne, and Gloria Lynne over the next few years. His compositions were recorded by Vaughan as well as by Cal Tjader, Horace Silver, and Blue Mitchell. In 1964, he became Nancy Wilson's arranger and pianist after moving to Los Angeles. Later in the decade he found work as a studio musician, playing in Supersax from 1972 to 1974."@en .

He led his own bands late in the 1920s and early in the 1930s; it was his band which played at the jazz funeral for Buddy Petit. He played in the Palace Theatre pit orchestra from 1938 to 1943. In 1943 he recorded with George Lewis, considered to be among his best recordings. In 1946 he led the Original Zenith Brass Band, but played only locally for the next few years. In 1952 he returned to playing with Lewis, where he would remain until 1961. His later recordings with Lewis are uneven because he was battling with alcoholism, which interfered with his abilities as a soloist. He fell ill in 1961 and left Lewis's band, and upon his recovery he led his own band from 1961 to 1965 and recorded several times; these recordings were also highly praised. He continued to play in New Orleans at Preservation Hall and other venues up until his death of a brain hemorrhage in 1966."@en .

Greer was born in Long Branch, New Jersey, and played with Elmer Snowden's band and the Howard Theatre's orchestra in Washington, D.C. before joining Duke Ellington, whom he met in 1919. He was Ellington's first drummer, playing with his quintet, the Washingtonians, and moving with Ellington into the Cotton Club. As a result of his job as a designer with the Leedy Drum Company of Indiana, Greer was able to build up a huge drum kit worth over $3,000, as well as chimes, a gong, timpani, and vibes. Greer was a heavy drinker, as well as a pool-hall hustler (when he needed to retrieve his drums from the pawnbroker), and in 1950 Ellington responded to his drinking and occasional unreliability by taking a second drummer, Butch Ballard, with them on a tour of Scandinavia. This enraged Greer, and the consequent argument led to their permanent estrangement. Greer continued to play, mainly as a free-lance drummer, working with musicians such as Johnny Hodges, Red Allen, J. C. Higginbotham, Tyree Glenn, and Brooks Kerr, as well as appearing in films, and briefly leading his own band. He was part of a tribute to Ellington in 1974, which achieved great success throughout the United States."@en .

Oddly enough he and Carmen McRae were neighbors and in-laws. He held a regular gig at the Renaissance Casino and also worked the Alhambra Ballroom in Harlem, which featured high-level dancing. Frankie Manning was among Andrade's admirers. He remained at the Renaissance until 1938; members of his band included Pete Briggs, Ernest Hill, and Zutty Singleton. Helen Humes recorded with Andrade's band on Okeh Records, but other than this, Andrade recorded little in his career, and was largely forgotten as a result. Nevertheless, his style of arrangements was an influence on bandleaders like Fletcher Henderson and Chick Webb. Andrade spent the later years of his life teaching piano and violin."@en .

Hakim credits jazz vibraphonist Mike Mainieri with giving him his first break in 1980; Hakim appeared in a video with Mainieri called The Jazz Life and began working with singer Carly Simon through Mainieri. Hakim first came to major attention as a member of Weather Report and then Sting's Blue Turtles band, appearing in the film Bring On the Night. In 1984, Hakim did most of the drum work on Dire Straits' album Brothers in Arms, when the previous drummer Terry Williams' performance was found unsuitable for the desired sound of the album after most of the songs had already been recorded. Hakim recorded all the drum tracks on the album in two days and then left. Williams was, however, brought back for the tour. Between 1988 and 1989 he appeared regularly as the house band drummer in The Sunday Night Band during the first half season of the acclaimed music performance program Sunday Night on NBC late-night television. After being temporarily replaced by drummer J. T. Lewis for the remainder of that season, Hakim reappeared in the band for the second season in the fall of 1989, when the program returned under the new name Night Music. Notable artists he has played with are Anita Baker, Sting, Weather Report, Mariah Carey, Madonna, David Bowie, Miles Davis, Chic, Bryan Ferry, Aziza Mustafa Zadeh, Everything but the Girl, Marcus Miller, Kazumi Watanabe, Lee Ritenour, The Rippingtons, Bobby McFerrin, among others."@en .

Reagan served as President of the Screen Actors Guild and later as a spokesman for General Electric (GE); his start in politics occurred during his work for GE. Originally a member of the Democratic Party, his positions began shifting rightward in the 1950s, and he switched to the Republican Party in 1962. After delivering a rousing speech in support of Barry Goldwater's presidential candidacy in 1964, he was persuaded to seek the California governorship, winning two years later and again in 1970. He was defeated in his run for the Republican presidential nomination in 1968 and in 1976, but won both the nomination and general election in 1980, defeating incumbent Jimmy Carter. As president, Reagan implemented sweeping new political and economic initiatives. His supply-side economic policies, dubbed \"Reaganomics\", advocated reducing tax rates to spur economic growth, controlling the money supply to reduce inflation, deregulation of the economy, and reducing government spending. In his first term he survived an assassination attempt, took a hard line against labor unions, and ordered an invasion of Grenada. He was re-elected in a landslide in 1984, proclaiming that it was \"Morning in America\". His second term was primarily marked by foreign matters, such as the ending of the Cold War, the 1986 bombing of Libya, and the revelation of the Iran-Contra affair. Publicly describing the Soviet Union as an \"evil empire\", he supported anti-communist movements worldwide and spent his first term forgoing the strategy of d\u00E9tente by ordering a massive military buildup in an arms race with the USSR. Reagan negotiated with Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, culminating in the INF Treaty and the decrease of both countries' nuclear arsenals. Reagan left office in 1989. In 1994, the former president disclosed that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease earlier in the year; he died ten years later at the age of 93. A conservative icon, he ranks highly in public opinion polls of U.S. Presidents and is credited for generating an ideological renaissance on the American political right."@en .

Dietrich remained popular throughout her long career by continually re-inventing herself, professionally and characteristically. In the Berlin of the 1920s, she acted on the stage and in silent films. Her performance as \"Lola-Lola\" in The Blue Angel, directed by Josef von Sternberg, brought her international fame and provided her a contract with Paramount Pictures in the US. Hollywood films such as Shanghai Express and Desire capitalised on her glamour and exotic looks, cementing her stardom and making her one of the highest-paid actresses of the era. Dietrich became a U.S. citizen in 1939, and throughout World War II she was a high-profile frontline entertainer. Although she still made occasional films in the post-war years, Dietrich spent most of the 1950s to the 1970s touring the world as a successful show performer. In 1999, the American Film Institute named Dietrich the ninth-greatest female star of all time."@en .

Ulanov's father was Nathan Ulanov, concertmaster in Arturo Toscanini's NBC Philharmonic. His father taught him violin, but after a car crash in which he broke both wrists, he ceased studying the instrument. He studied at Columbia University, taking his BA there in 1939, and wrote about jazz as a student. Soon after graduating he edited several magazines and journals on music. He edited the journal Metronome from 1943 to 1955, and shifted its focus from Western art music to cover more jazz music, especially black musicians, who had heretofore received little notice in the journal. Ulanov was an early advocate of bebop, especially Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, and Lennie Tristano (who wrote a composition, Coolin' Off With Ulanov). He organized several concerts of bop stars for WOR radio in 1947. He received his Ph.D. from Columbia in the 1950s. From 1955-58 he wrote for Down Beat, and published several biographies of jazz musicians in the 1940s and 1950s. In his autobiography Miles Davis referred to Ulanov as the only white critic who ever understood him or Charlie Parker. He taught at Juilliard (1946), Princeton (1950\u201351), and Barnard College (1951\u20131988) as well as at Columbia University and Union Theological Seminary. In 1962 he received a Guggenheim Fellowship. Ulanov converted to Catholicism in 1951, and began to write more on the subjects of religion and psychology from the 1960s. He was the president of the Catholic Renascence Society and founder of the St. Thomas More Society; he and his wife, Joan Bel Geddes, translated many essays and books on Catholicism. He served on the council for Vatican II, advocating for use of the vernacular in the Mass. He advocated the use of amplified music in church, including rock music. In the last twenty years of his life, Ulanov concentrated on explorations of religion and psychology, and published over 10 books with his second wife Ann Belford Ulanov, Professor of Psychiatry and Religion at Union Theological Seminary in New York and psychoanalyst in private practice. The Annual Barry Ulanov Memorial Lecture Series is held each year at Union."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cozy_Cole> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Cozy Cole (October 17, 1909 \u2013 January 9, 1981) was an American jazz drummer who scored a #1 Cashbox magazine hit with the record \"Topsy Part 2\". \"Topsy\" peaked at number three on Billboard Hot 100, and at number one on the R&B chart. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. The track peaked at No. \u00A029 in the UK Singles Chart in 1958. The recording contained a lengthy drum solo, and was one of the few drum solo recordings that ever made the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The single was issued on the tiny Brooklyn-based Love Records label. William Randolph Cole was born in 1909 in East Orange, New Jersey. His first music job was with Wilbur Sweatman in 1928. In 1930 he played for Jelly Roll Morton's Red Hot Peppers, recording an early drum solo on \"Load of Cole\". He spent 1931\u201333 with Blanche Calloway, 1933-34 with Benny Carter, 1935-36 with Willie Bryant, 1936-38 with Stuff Smith's small combo, and 1938-42 with Cab Calloway. In 1942, he was hired by CBS Radio music director Raymond Scott as part of network radio's first mixed-race orchestra. After that he played with Louis Armstrong's All Stars. Cole appeared in music-related films, including a brief cameo in Don't Knock the Rock. Throughout the 1960s and '70s Cole continued to perform in a variety of settings. Cole and Gene Krupa often played duets at the Metropole in New York City during the 1950s and 1960s. He died of cancer in 1981, in Columbus, Ohio. Cole is cited as an influence by many contemporary rock drummers, including Cozy Powell, who took his nickname \"Cozy\" from Cole."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Billy_Gladstone> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Billy Gladstone (December 15, 1893 \u2013 October 1961), born William Goldstein, was a Romanian-born New York drummer, percussionist, drum builder, inventor, and drum teacher who performed in New York theaters, including the Capitol Theatre and most famously Radio City Music Hall in the 1930s and 1940s. He was perhaps most famous in his day for his snare-drum technique, which is often referred to in the drumming community as \"The Gladstone Technique\". This technique involves the use of the fingers to control the rebound of the drum stick, as opposed to the \"Moeller Method\" which utilizes a fluid whipping motion to control stick rebound. Both Gladstone and Moeller are now popularly noted for their individually named techniques, but it is unlikely that either drummer single-handedly invented either technique from scratch. More likely they both observed other experienced drummers and instructors of their time and later expanded and popularized each technique via modern publications and private drum instruction. As a teacher, Gladstone taught, formally or informally, a number of noted jazz drummers, including Joe Morello, Shelly Manne, and Buddy Rich. As an inventor and drum builder he devised his own special drum kits bearing his name. These rare snare drums are considered highly collectible today. Among his inventions is a rare jazz instrument similar to the Bock-a-da-bock, a hand-held cymbal apparatus called the \u201CLudwig Gladstone Cymbal\u201D when it was introduced by the Ludwig Drum Company in 1927. In 1929 the Leedy Drum Company listed it in their catalogue as the \u201CHand Sock Cymbals. \u201D Gladstone was granted a patent September 27, 1927, for his \"Operating Device for Cymbals,\" his first commercially accepted patent (his previous patents were not mass-produced). This launched an illustrious career as an inventor of percussion and non-percussion items."@en .

Over time, Ives came to be regarded as an \"American original\". Ives combined the American popular and church-music traditions of his youth with European art music, and was among the first composers to engage in a systematic program of experimental music, with musical techniques including polytonality, polyrhythm, tone clusters, aleatoric elements, and quarter tones, foreshadowing many musical innovations of the 20th century. Sources of Ives' tonal imagery are hymn tunes and traditional songs, the town band at holiday parade, the fiddlers at Saturday night dances, patriotic songs, sentimental parlor ballads, and the melodies of Stephen Foster."@en .

He was a prominent bebop drummer in the 1950s and early '60s. Best, who was trained on piano, trumpet, and bass, concentrated on the drums starting in 1943. Between 1943 and 1944 he worked with Ben Webster, and subsequently with Coleman Hawkins (1944\u20131945), Illinois Jacquet (1946) and Chubby Jackson. The drummer was known to sit in at Minton's Playhouse. He took part in a recording with George Shearing in 1948 and was a founding member of his Quartet, remaining there until 1952. In 1949 he played on a recording with Lennie Tristano and also recorded later with Lee Konitz. After a car accident he played in 1954 with Artie Shaw, and then in a trio with Erroll Garner (1955\u20131957). Following this he played with Phineas Newborn, Nina Simone, Billie Holiday and Tyree Glenn. In 1962 he appeared on the first release by Sheila Jordan. He suffered from paralysis after this and was no longer able to play; he died after falling down a staircase in a New York Subway station. Unlike many bebop percussionists, who loaded the musical space with accents against the prevailing meter and thus created rhythmic intensity, Best resumed the legato development of Jo Jones. He played on the beat and rarely used loud accents. Playing in this way he was not only a model for cool jazz but also influenced countless bar combos. Best composed several well-known bebop tunes, such as \"Move\", \"Wee\", and \"Dee Dee's Dance\", as well as (possibly) Thelonious Monk's \"Bemsha Swing\". His composition \"45 Degree Angel\" was recorded by Herbie Nichols and Mary Lou Williams."@en .

Dickenson's career started out in the 1920s and led him through musical partnerships with such legends as Count Basie (1940\u201341), Sidney Bechet (1941) and Earl Hines . Also a soloist of wide acclaim, Vic Dickenson was known for the distinctive sound he coaxed out of the trombone. He studied Organ from 1922 but changed to Trombone with local bands. Vic made his recording debut in December 1930, as a vocalist with Luis Russell's band. He later joined Blanche Calloway's Orchestra in the early 1930s. Led his own groups both in east & west coast between 1947 to mid fifties. From then he was a session man for many legendary dates, among them CBS Sound Of Jazz 1957 with many great jazz musicians including: Count Basie, Coleman Hawkins, Roy Eldridge, Gerry Mulligan, Billie Holiday. He was a favorite of many musicians, in large part because of the melodic sound he got from his horn, and for a keen sense of humor which was often evident in his playing. Dickenson recorded several albums, many of which are still in print. But if you're looking for more, listen to these recordings under the name of other jazz musicians with Vic as a sideman: Jimmy Rushing (Vanguard Rec. ), Coleman Hawkins (Capitol Rec. ), Pee Wee Russell (Black Lion Rec. ), Benny Carter (BlueBird & Black & Blue Rec. ), Lester Young (Blue Note & Verve Rec. ), Count Basie (Columbia & Pablo Rec. ), Sidney Bechet (BlueBird, Black & Blue & Blue Note Rec. ) In 1953, he recorded 'The Vic Dickenson Showcase' for Vanguard. The front line included Ed Hall (clarinet) and Ruby Braff (Trumpet). This album is thought by many as one of the finest examples of mainstream jazz ever recorded. At one time he was a member of \"The World's Greatest Jazz Band,\" which was the house band at The Roosevelt Grill in NYC. He also performed at the same venue in a smaller group that featured Dickenson with trumpeter Bobby Hackett. Dickenson is in Art Kane's photograph, A Great Day in Harlem... which also includes (another trombonist) Miff Mole. Dickenson, for all his lively musical talent, was a laconic man who often liked to be alone between sets. During his longtime association with bands playing at Eddie Condon's, he would often retire to a single chair which sat in a small alcove just outside the men's room, instead of gathering with fellow musicians in the band room. When men mistook him for the men's room attendant and offered him dollars, he took them. Dickenson was born in Xenia, Ohio and died in New York City."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tom_Brown_(trombonist)> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Tom Brown (June 3, 1888 \u2013 March 25, 1958), sometimes known by the nickname Red Brown, was an early New Orleans dixieland jazz trombonist. He also played string bass professionally. Tom P. Brown was born in Uptown New Orleans, Louisiana. His younger brother Steve Brown also became a prominent professional musician. He played trombone with the bands of Papa Jack Laine and Frank Christian; by 1910 usually worked leading bands under his own name. The band played in a style then locally known as \"hot ragtime\" or \"ratty music\". In early 1915, his band was heard by Vaudeville dancer Joe Frisco who then arranged a job for Brown's band in Chicago, Illinois. On May 15, 1915, Tom Brown's Band from Dixieland opened up at Lamb's Cafe at Clark & Randolph Streets in Chicago, with Ray Lopez, cornet and manager; Tom Brown, trombone and leader; Gussie Mueller clarinet, Arnold Loyacano piano and string bass; and Billy Lambert on drums. In Chicago Gussie Mueller was hired by bandleader Bert Kelly, and his place was taken by young New Orleans clarinetist Larry Shields. This band seems to be the first to be popularly referred to as playing \"Jazz\", or, as it was spelled early on, \"Jass\". According to Brown, once his band started enjoying popularity the local Chicago musicians union began picketing his band of non-union out-of-towners. One picketer's placards intended to link Brown's band with the Storyville prostitution district of New Orleans and the implied disreputable low life status; the signs read \"Don't Patronize This Jass Music\". The term \"jass\" at that time had a sexual connotation. The signs had the opposite of the intended effect; more people came to hear the band out of curiosity as to what \"Jass Music\" might be and how it could be performed in public. Brown realized the publicity potential and started calling his group \"Brown's Jass Band\". Some recently rediscovered Chicago newspaper advertisements list it as \"Brown's Jab Band\" or \"Jad Band\", confirming the reminiscences of Ray Lopez that the bandmembers assumed that \"Jass\" was too rude a word to be printed in the newspapers so they looked in a dictionary for printable words close to it, like \"jade\". Years later, Brown would frequently brag that he led \"the first white jazz band\" to go up north. Brown's careful wording implies that he was aware that the Original Creole Orchestra preceded him and that they played jazz. Tom Brown's Band enjoyed over four months of success in Chicago before moving to New York City, where it played for four months more before returning to New Orleans in February 1916. Upon arriving home Brown immediately started rounding up another band to go back to Chicago with him. The group again included Larry Shields; at the end of October, Brown agreed to switch clarinetists with the Original Dixieland Jass Band bringing Alcide Nunez into his band. Brown, Nunez and New Orleans drummer Ragbaby Stevens then went to work for Bert Kelly, who brought them to New York where they temporarily replaced the Original Dixieland Jass Band at Reisenweber's in 1918. Brown started doing freelance recording work with New York dance and novelty bands, then joined the band of Harry Yerkes. At the start of 1920 he was joined in the Yerkes Band by Alcide Nunez. Tom Brown also played on Vaudeville in the acts of Joe Frisco and Ed Wynn. About late 1921 Brown returned to Chicago and joined Ray Miller's Black & White Melody Boys, with whom he made more recordings. During this period he also co-lead a dance band with his brother Steve. In the mid 1920s he returned home to New Orleans where he played with Johnny Bayersdorffer and Norman Brownlee's bands, making a few excellent recordings. During the Great Depression he supplemented his income from music by repairing radios. He opened up a music shop and a junk shop on Magazine Street. He played string bass in local swing and dance bands. With the revival of interest in traditional jazz he played in various Dixieland bands in the 1950s, notably that of Johnny Wiggs. A local television station thought it would be a good idea to invite Brown and Nick LaRocca to talk about how jazz first spread north from New Orleans, but the show had scaresly started before the two old men got into an argument that turned into a fist-fight. Tom Brown made his last recording just weeks before his death, his trombone playing apparently not suffering from the fact that he had neither teeth nor dentures at the time. Brown died in New Orleans."@en .

Hodges was also featured on soprano saxophone, but refused to play soprano after 1946, when he was given the lead chair. He is considered one of the definitive alto saxophones players of the Big Band Era. Hodges started playing with Lloyd Scott, Sidney Bechet, Lucky Roberts and Chick Webb. When Ellington wanted to expand his band in 1928, Ellington's clarinet player Barney Bigard recommended Hodges, who was featured on both alto and soprano sax. His playing became one of the identifying voices of the Ellington orchestra. Hodges left the Duke to lead his own band (1951\u20131955), but returned to the large ensemble shortly before Ellington's triumphant return to prominence \u2013 the orchestra's performance at the 1956 Newport Jazz Festival."@en .

He was born in The Narrows, Georgia, a small rural community of farmers that was not an official city or village at the time. Cobb spent 22 seasons with the Detroit Tigers, the last six as the team's player-manager, and finished his career with the Philadelphia Athletics. In 1936 Cobb received the most votes of any player on the inaugural Baseball Hall of Fame ballot, receiving 222 out of a possible 226 votes. Cobb is widely credited with setting 90 Major League Baseball records during his career. He still holds several records as of 2013, including the highest career batting average (.366 or .367, depending on source) and most career batting titles with 11 (or 12, depending on source). He retained many other records for almost a half century or more, including most career hits until 1985 (4,189 or 4,191, depending on source), most career runs (2,245 or 2,246 depending on source) until 2001, most career games played (3,035) and at bats (11,429 or 11,434 depending on source) until 1974, and the modern record for most career stolen bases (892) until 1977. He still holds the career record for stealing home (54 times). Cobb committed 271 errors in his career, the most by any American League outfielder. Cobb's legacy as an athlete has sometimes been overshadowed by his surly temperament and aggressive playing style, which was described by the Detroit Free Press as \"daring to the point of dementia. \" Cobb himself wrote shortly before his death, \"In legend I am a sadistic, slashing, swashbuckling despot who waged war in the guise of sport. \" Since his death, his legacy (which includes a generous college scholarship fund for Georgia residents, funded by his early investments in Coca-Cola and General Motors) has been tarnished by allegations of racism and violence. But the reputation of Cobb as an extremely violent man was fanned by sportswriter Al Stump, his first biographer, whose veracity has been called into question, while Cobb's views on race evolved later in his life."@en .

McPhatter was lead tenor for The Mount Lebanon Singers, a gospel group he formed as a teenager. ; and later, lead tenor for Billy Ward and His Dominoes. McPhatter was largely responsible for the success the Dominoes initially enjoyed. After his tenure with the Dominoes, McPhatter formed his own group, The Drifters before going solo.

One of the greatest jazz trumpeters of all time (some would say the best), Gillespie was such a complex player that his contemporaries ended up copying Miles Davis and Fats Navarro instead, and it was not until Jon Faddis's emergence in the 1970s that Dizzy's style was successfully recreated . . . Arguably Gillespie is remembered, by both critics and fans alike, as one of the greatest jazz trumpeters of all time. \" Gillespie was a trumpet virtuoso and improviser, building on the virtuoso style of Roy Eldridge but adding layers of harmonic complexity previously unknown in jazz. His beret and horn-rimmed spectacles, his scat singing, his bent horn, pouched cheeks and his light-hearted personality were essential in popularizing bebop. In the 1940s Gillespie, together with Charlie Parker, became a major figure in the development of bebop and modern jazz. He taught and influenced many other musicians, including trumpeters Miles Davis, Fats Navarro, Clifford Brown, Arturo Sandoval, Lee Morgan, Jon Faddis and Chuck Mangione."@en .

Albert's uncle was Natty Dominique, and he was also a relative of Barney Bigard. He got his start playing in parade brass bands in New Orleans at the beginning of the 1920s. He toured with the territory band of Alphonse Trent through the Southwest United States in 1925, then played with Troy Floyd at the Shadowland Ballroom in San Antonio from 1926 to 1929. Albert led his own territory bands out of Texas in the 1930s and 1940s, with sidemen that included Alvin Alcorn, Louis Cottrell, Jr. , and Herb Hall. After 1932 he acted more in a manager's capacity than as a performer. His bands played in Mexico, Canada, and New York City in 1937 and won rave reviews from newspapers, but the band only recorded eight sides for Vocalion Records. He disbanded this group around 1939 due to economic conditions, and found work in civil service and managing a nightclub in San Antonio in the early and mid-1940s; his club was shut down in 1948 by local authorities. He led a group at the Palace Theater in New York in 1949. In the 1950s he returned to active performance, playing in small groups in the 1950s through the 1970s. He played with Buddy Tate in New York in 1966 and at the New Orleans Jazz Festival in 1969."@en .

Brubeck's style ranged from refined to bombastic, reflecting his mother's attempts at classical training and his improvisational skills. His music is known for employing unusual time signatures, and superimposing contrasting rhythms, meters, and tonalities. His long-time musical partner, alto saxophonist Paul Desmond, wrote the saxophone melody for the Dave Brubeck Quartet's best remembered piece, \"Take Five\", which is in 5/4 time and has endured as a jazz classic on one of the top-selling jazz albums, Time Out. Brubeck experimented with time signatures throughout his career, recording \"Pick Up Sticks\" in 6/4, \"Unsquare Dance\" in 7/4, \"World's Fair\" in 13/4, and \"Blue Rondo \u00E0 la Turk\" in 9/8.

Davis was born in Glasgow, Missouri. He is best known for his pioneering jazz electronic organ recordings and for his tenure with the Tympany Five, the legendary backing group for Louis Jordan. Prior to the emergence of Jimmy Smith in 1956, Davis (whom Smith had reportedly first seen playing organ in the 1930s) was the pacesetter among organists. He originally played guitar and wrote arrangements for Milt Larkin's Texas-based big band during 1939\u20131942, a band which also included Arnett Cobb, Illinois Jacquet, and Tom Archia on horns. After leaving the Larkin orchestra, Davis worked in Chicago as a pianist, recording with Buster Bennett in 1945. He played a crucial role as the pianist-arranger in Louis Jordan's Tympany Five (1945\u20131947) at the peak of their success. After leaving Jordan, he returned to Chicago for a time, recording again with Buster Bennett and working with Claude McLin. After switching from piano to organ, Davis moved to the East Coast. In 1950, he began leading an influential trio of organ, guitar, and drums, which recorded for OKeh. Davis was originally supposed to record \"April in Paris\" with Count Basie's Orchestra in 1955 but when he could not make the session, Basie used his arrangement for the full band and had a major hit. In addition to working with his own groups in the 1960s, Davis made several albums with his friend Johnny Hodges, leading to tours during 1969\u20131971 with Duke Ellington. In the 1970s he recorded for the Black & Blue Records label with a variety of swing all-stars, and he also played with Lionel Hampton, appearing at festivals through the early 1990s."@en .

Zardis played bass from a young age, and studied under Billy Marrero of the Superior Orchestra. In his teens he was involved in a fistfight at a New Orleans theater, which resulted in his being sent to the Jones Waif Home. While there he began playing with another of the Home's residents, Louis Armstrong. He joined Buddy Petit's orchestra at age 16, and worked as a bassist in nightclubs and a tubist in brass bands in New Orleans in the 1920s, playing with Kid Rena, A.J. Piron, Punch Miller, Kid Howard, Jack Carey, Fate Marable, and Duke Dejan's Dixie Rhythm Band. He was given the nickname \"Little Bear\" by Fats Pichon, a bandleader with whom Zardis played on the riverboat S.S. Capital in the 1930s. During that decade he also played with Count Basie in New York City, and recorded with George Lewis and Bunk Johnson. During the Second World War Zardis served in the Army, then worked briefly as a sheriff in the Western United States. Upon his return to New Orleans he played with Andy Anderson, but quit music between 1954 and 1964. When he returned to active performance, Zardis played often at Preservation Hall with Lewis and Percy Humphrey among many others. He continued to be a fixture of the New Orleans jazz scene up until his death in 1990, including several international tours. Zardis was regularly featured in documentaries; he is himself the subject of three of them, Liberty Street Blues, Chester Zardis: Spirit of New Orleans, and Three Men of Jazz."@en .

She also became famous for singing \"Easy Living\", \"Good Morning Heartache\", and \"Strange Fruit\", a protest song which became one of her standards and was made famous with her 1939 recording.

He was also an arranger and composer, and one of his compositions, \"Undecided\", is a jazz standard. Charlie Shavers' father (a distant relative of Fats Navarro) was from the prominent Shavers family of Key West, Florida, and Charlie was a cousin of heavyweight boxer Earnie Shavers. Born in New York City, he originally took up the piano and banjo before switching to trumpet. In the mid-thirties, he performed with Tiny Bradshaw and Lucky Millinder. In 1936 he joined John Kirby's Sextet as trumpet soloist and arranger (he was only 16 but gave his birthdate as 1917 in order to avoid child labor laws - many biographies still list this date). His arrangements and solos with this band contributed greatly towards making it one of the most commercially successful and widely imitated bands of its day. In 1937 he was performing with Midge Williams and her Jazz Jesters. In 1944 he began playing sessions in Raymond Scott's CBS staff orchestra. In 1945 he left John Kirby's band to join Tommy Dorsey's Orchestra, with whom he toured and recorded, off and on, until 1953. During this time he continued to play sessions at CBS, played with the Metronome All-Stars, and made a number of recordings as trumpet soloist with Billie Holiday. From 1953 to 1954 he worked with Benny Goodman, and toured Europe with Norman Granz's popular Jazz at the Philharmonic series, where he was always a crowd favorite. He went on to form his own band with Terry Gibbs and Louie Bellson. Charlie Shavers died from throat cancer in New York in 1971 at the age of 50. His friend Louis Armstrong died while Shavers was on his deathbed, and his last request was that his trumpet mouthpiece be buried with Armstrong in his coffin."@en .

Louis Nelson was born on September 17, 1902 at 1419-21 Touro St. in New Orleans, LA. His father, Dr. George Harry Nelson, was a medical doctor. Dr. Nelson helped organize the 9th Louisiana Volunteers and served in the Spanish-American War. He was commissioned as first lieutenant. During the war he served in Cuba and also stormed San Juan Hill. His mother, Anna Hattie Adams Nelson, was a teacher and pianist from Springfield, Massachusetts. She was a descendant of runaway slaves from the Eastern Shore of Maryland. She was a graduate of the Boston Conservatory of Music. His mother moved to Louisiana to teach where she met his father. They had three children: Mary Nelson Welch, George Harry Nelson Jr. and Louis Hall Nelson. Both parents and his sister played the piano. His brother played the saxophone. In December 1902, his parents moved to Napoleonville, Louisiana because his father couldn't get medical patients after the July 1900 Robert Charles Race Riots in New Orleans. At the age of 15, while living in Napoleonville, Louis Nelson started playing the valve trombone and switched to the slide trombone, studying under Professor Claiborne Williams of Donaldsonville, Louisiana. Mr. Nelson credited Professor Claiborne Williams with teaching him the proper way to breathe. Williams also taught him that technique and intuition were far more important than technical skill. Mr. Nelson was quoted as saying \"I heard a fellow, Lawrence Johnson, playing with a band out of Napoleonville. I said, one day I'm going to play trombone like that man. He had a smooth tone, and gave the notes the full value. That's why I followed in his footsteps. \" Weekdays, Louis Nelson lived with Reverend Isaac H. Hall in New Orleans, LA. Reverend Hall was a family friend who raised Mr. Nelson\u2019s father. Mr. Nelson attended the Lutheran School on Annette St. and New Orleans University (high school) on St. Charles Ave. in New Orleans, LA, graduating in 1919. Louis Nelson\u2019s first band was Joe Gabriel's band of Thibodeaux, Louisiana. With Joe Gabriel's band, he traveled through Cajun country, playing in dance halls for a dollar a night. Mr. Nelson married Julia Kissack in 1922. Louis Nelson and his wife moved to New Orleans after a brief stay in New York City as a Pullman porter because she was ill. While in New Orleans in the 1920s, Mr. Nelson played jazz music with: Buddy Petit, Kid Rena, Kid Punch Miller, Sam Morgan (musician), Chris Kelly (jazz), Papa Celestin, Willie Pajeaud, Kid Howard, Sidney Cates and Kid Harris' Dixieland Band. Louis and Julia Kissack Nelson had two children: Louis Hall Nelson Jr. (deceased) and Anna Nelson Tircuit. Julia Kissack Nelson died in 1928 from pregnancy complications. After his wife's death, Mr. Nelson joined the Sidney Desvigne Orchestra. This group played for white audiences in such spots as the New Orleans Country Club and the Southern Yacht Club. Monday and Tuesday nights were reserved for black audiences at such venues as the Pythian Temple and the Bulls Aids and Pleasure Club. During his 15 years with Desvigne's 10 piece Orchestra, Mr. Nelson played for summer Mississippi River cruises on the steamer S.S. Capitol, traveling as far north as Minneapolis/St. Paul, MN. To get work during the Depression, Louis Nelson joined the Works Progress Administration and became first chair in the WPA band. Between engagements, the musicians dug stumps at City Park in New Orleans. When WWII came along, Mr. Nelson volunteered for the U. S. Navy and became Musician 1st Class at the U.S. Navy base in Memphis, Tennessee. After serving in the Navy, Mr. Nelson returned to New Orleans and resumed playing with Sidney Desvigne's Orchestra until Desvigne moved to California. Mr. Nelson joined the hard-driving Kid Thomas Valentine band in 1945. With this band, he played one night a week at dance halls like the Tip Top, Fireman's Hall in Westwego, LA, and Speck's Moulin Rouge in Marrero, LA. He also worked for the Herbert Leary Orchestra at this time. To make ends meet, Mr. Nelson was forced to take day jobs such as a driver for the post office and for a fish merchant. He also worked as a chauffeur and as a janitor. In 1949, Louis Nelson made his first recording with clarinetist and leader Big Eye Louis Nelson Delisle, as well as Charlie Love, Johnny St. Cyr, Ernest Rogers, and Austin Young at Dr. Nelson's Touro Street house. This recording, by jazz historian Bill Russell of AM Records, marked the beginning of Mr. Nelson\u2019s extensive recording career. In the 1950s, New Orleans French Quarter art gallery owner Larry Borenstein liked to go to the West Bank to hear the Kid Thomas Valentine band play in the evenings, but because he had to keep his art gallery at 726 St. Peter Street open at night, his ability to hear jazz music was limited. As a result, Borenstein asked Kid Thomas Valentine to play jazz sessions, which he called \"rehearsals\", in order to avoid union trouble. In 1961, Barbara Reed went to Baton Rouge to get a charter named The Society for the Preservation of Traditional New Orleans Jazz. This charter gave them a non-profit corporate license status as they could not afford the entertainment tax when Ms. Reed and Grayson Mills, among others, officially opened Preservation Hall in 1961. Later that year, Allan Jaffe took over Preservation Hall. Louis Nelson also played at the Paddock Lounge and later at Dixieland Hall, both on Bourbon Street. Because of Preservation Hall, Mr. Nelson now had permanent work, exposure to a new audience and was provided numerous opportunities for travel abroad as both a soloist and band member of the Billie and De De Piece and Kid Thomas Valentine's bands. Louis Nelson toured extensively from 1963, beginning with the George Lewis (clarinetist) band in Japan, Eastern, Western Europe, South America, Australia, Canada and Mexico, as well as the United States, until his death in 1990. Mr. Nelson appeared at every New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival until his death. Mr. Nelson joined the Legends of Jazz. In 1981, Mr. Nelson received a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts where he developed a program in which he played for New Orleans public school students and discussed New Orleans jazz history. On April 5, 1990, Mr. Nelson died of injuries suffered from a March 27 hit and run automobile accident. The driver was never caught. Widely recorded, including music for the movie Pretty Baby (1978 film) starring Brooke Shields, Mr. Nelson also appeared in many New Orleans jazz documentaries, including Art Ford's House Party, Live the Jazz, Three Men of Jazz and Till the Butcher Cut Him Down."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patti_Page> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Clara Ann Fowler (November 8, 1927\u00A0\u2013 January 1, 2013), known by her professional name Patti Page, was an American singer and one of the best-known female artists in traditional pop music. She was the best-selling female artist of the 1950s, and sold over 100 million records. She was often introduced as \"the Singin' Rage, Miss Patti Page\". A New York disc jockey on WNEW, William B. Williams, introduced her as \"A Page in my life called Patti\". Page signed with Mercury Records in 1947, and became their first successful female artist, starting with 1948's \"Confess\". In 1950, she had her first million-selling single \"With My Eyes Wide Open, I'm Dreaming\", and would eventually have 14 additional million-selling singles between 1950 and 1965. Page's signature song, \"Tennessee Waltz\", recorded in 1950, was one of the biggest-selling singles of the 20th century, and is also one of the nine official state songs of Tennessee. \"Tennessee Waltz\" spent 13 weeks atop the Billboard magazine's Best-Sellers List in 1950. Page had three additional No. \u00A01 hit singles between 1950 and 1953, with \"All My Love (Bolero)\", \"I Went to Your Wedding\", and \"(How Much Is That) Doggie in the Window\". Unlike most pop music singers, Page blended the styles of country music into many of her most popular songs. By doing this, many of Page's singles also made the Billboard Country Chart. Towards the 1970s, Page shifted her career towards country music, and she began charting on the country charts, up until 1982. Page was one of the few vocalists to have made the country charts in five separate decades. When rock and roll music became popular during the second half of the 1950s, traditional pop music was becoming less popular. Page was one of the few traditional pop music singers who was able to sustain her success, continuing to have major hits into the mid-1960s with \"Old Cape Cod\", \"Allegheny Moon\", \"A Poor Man's Roses (Or a Rich Man's Gold)\", and \"Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte\". In 1997, Patti Page was inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame. She will be posthumously honored with the Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award in 2013."@en .

From the late 1910s on, Barbarin divided his time between Chicago, New York City and New Orleans, and touring with such bands as those of Joe \"King\" Oliver, Luis Russell, Louis Armstrong, and Henry Red Allen. From the 1950s on he usually led his own band. He, along with Louis Cottrell, Jr. founded and led the second incarnation of the Onward Brass Band from 1960 to 1969. Barbarin was an accomplished and knowledgeable musician, a member of ASCAP, and the composer of a number of pop tunes and Dixieland standards, including \"Come Back Sweet Papa\", \"Don't Forget to Mess Around (When You're Doing the Charleston)\", \"Bourbon Street Parade\", and \"(Paul Barbarin's) Second Line\".

Robinson broke the baseball color line when the Brooklyn Dodgers started him at first base on April 15, 1947. As the first major league team to play a black man since the 1880s, the Dodgers ended racial segregation that had relegated black players to the Negro leagues for six decades. The example of Robinson's character and unquestionable talent challenged the traditional basis of segregation, which then marked many other aspects of American life, and contributed significantly to the Civil Rights Movement. In addition to his cultural impact, Robinson had an exceptional baseball career. Over ten seasons, all of which but the first he played at second base, Robinson played in six World Series and contributed to the Dodgers' 1955 World Championship. He was selected for six consecutive All-Star Games, from 1949 to 1954, was the recipient of the inaugural MLB Rookie of the Year Award in 1947, and won the National League Most Valuable Player Award in 1949\u2014the first black player so honored. Robinson was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962. In 1997, Major League Baseball \"universally\" retired his uniform number, 42, across all major league teams; he was the first pro athlete in any sport to be so honored. Initiated for the first time on April 15, 2004, Major League Baseball has adopted a new annual tradition, \"Jackie Robinson Day,\" on which every player on every team wears #42. Robinson was also known for his pursuits outside the baseball diamond. He was the first black television analyst in MLB, and the first black vice-president of a major American corporation. In the 1960s, he helped establish the Freedom National Bank, an African-American-owned financial institution based in Harlem, New York. In recognition of his achievements on and off the field, Robinson was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal."@en .

He contributed songs to Broadway revues, formed the music publishing company Spier and Coslow with Larry Spier and made a number of recordings as a performer.

Coslow and his partner Larry Spier sold their publishing business to Paramount Pictures and Coslow became a Paramount songwriter. One of his first assignments for the studio was the score for the 1930 film The Virtuous Sin.

Along with Claude Debussy, he was one of the most prominent figures associated with Impressionist music. Much of his piano music, chamber music, vocal music and orchestral music has entered the standard concert repertoire. Ravel's piano compositions, such as Jeux d'eau, Miroirs, Le tombeau de Couperin and Gaspard de la nuit, demand considerable virtuosity from the performer, and his orchestral music, including Daphnis et Chlo\u00E9 and his arrangement of Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition, use a variety of sound and instrumentation. Ravel is perhaps known best for his orchestral work Bol\u00E9ro (1928), which he considered trivial and once described as \"a piece for orchestra without music\". According to SACEM, Ravel's estate had earned more royalties than that of any other French composer (until, that is, January 1, 2008 when, according to the governing copyright laws of most countries around the world, including all members of the World Trade Organization, Ravel's works fell into the public domain)."@en .

He was orphaned as a child, but an uncle in Detroit (trombone player John Tobias) taught him to play. Buckner pioneered the parallel chords style which influenced Red Garland, George Shearing, Bill Evans, and Oscar Peterson. He first played in Detroit with the McKinney Cotton Pickers and then with Cab Calloway. In 1941 he joined Lionel Hampton's big band, and for the next seven years served as its pianist and staff arranger. He led a short-lived big band of his own for two years, but then returned to Hampton's in 1950. In 1952 he formed his own trio, concentrating on the Hammond organ. He often played in Europe in the late 60's. Buckner pioneered the use of the electric organ. He died in Chicago, Illinois, at the age of sixty-two. Buckner's brother, Ted Buckner, was a noted jazz saxophonist."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buddy_Baker_(composer)> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Norman \"Buddy\" Baker (January 4, 1918 \u2013 July 26, 2002) was an American composer who scored many Disney films, such as The Apple Dumpling Gang, The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again, The Shaggy D.A. , The Million Dollar Duck and The Fox and the Hound. Baker was born and raised in Springfield, Missouri, and got his degree in music from Southwest Baptist College. He later went to the West Coast in the 1930s to arrange music scores for radio. He became the Musical Director on Bob Hope's radio show. One of his first hits as a big band arranger on record was \"And Her Tears Flowed Like Wine\" for the Stan Kenton Orchestra. He later became a professor at L.A. City College in the early 1950s. Among his early students was Jerry Goldsmith. At about this time, his friend George Bruns asked him to compose music for the Disney television show Davy Crockett and the River Pirates. He stayed on at the Disney studio, and eventually became its music director, as well as chief composer for Disneyland and other Disney theme parks. Baker was nominated for an Academy Award for his score the film Napoleon and Samantha. His work appears in many Disney cartoons and featurettes, including Donald in Mathmagic Land, which was nominated for a 1959 Academy Award (Best Documentary - Short Subjects). In 1978, he composed the music for the first Walt Disney Home Video logo, known as the \"Neon Mickey\" logo. The music was a loud string fanfare. Baker arranged and conducted most of the Winnie-the-Pooh musical featurettes. In 1999 at the age of 82 he conducted the music for the The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh theme park attractions worldwide. The eerie music played throughout the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland was another work by Baker, as was the infectious theme to Walt Disney World's If You Had Wings. Baker arranged the medley of French classical music that accompanies the film Impressions de France at EPCOT Center, which artfully integrates works by Camille Saint-Sa\u00EBns, Claude Debussy and Erik Satie, among others. The music to the Tokyo DisneySea theme park attraction Journey to the Center of the Earth, which opened in 2001, was also composed by Baker. Baker retired from Disney having been the last contracted music staff composer still on contract at any studio. Although occasionally returning to work on theme park, film and television projects, he spent the majority of his later years teaching film scoring at the USC Thornton School of Music in Los Angeles. He held that job until his death in 2002. His interment was at Forest Lawn - Hollywood Hills Cemtery. In 2004, Baker's wife Charlotte donated his papers to the Fales Library at NYU."@en .

Known as \"The Ten Most Talented Fingers On Radio\", Fina was born in Passaic, New Jersey, and educated at the New York College of Music and was a student of August Fraemcke and Elsa Nicilini. He started out playing piano in Clyde McCoy's band sometime in the 1930s, but it wasn't until he joined Freddy Martin\u2019s band in 1936 that he gained real fame, when he was featured on Martin\u2019s famous recording of \"Tonight We Love\". After leaving Martin in 1946, Fina formed his own 16-piece band. His first appearance was at the Claremont Hotel. The vocals were handled by Harry Prime and Gil Lewis. With good air time and good recordings, Fina became a national figure. Because of this, Fina appeared at some of the top venues in the country, including the Waldorf-Astoria the Aragon Ballroom and the famous illegal gambling casino/night club in Galveston, the Balinese Room. He also appeared in several films, including Melody Time (sequence Bumble Boogie, 1948) and Disc Jockey (1951). A noted songwriter, his credits included Dream Sonata (his theme song), Chango and Piano Portraits. In the 1950s, he reduced the size of his band and settled in San Francisco. He also operated a talent agency called the Concerto Music & Entertainment Agency with his manager Al King. In the early 1960s, Fina led a small band at the Beverly Hills Hotel, where he remained for a successful eight years.

His only album recorded under his own name was The Chicago Sound, from 1957, while Ware was signed to Riverside. In 1958 Ware was one of 57 jazz musicians to appear in the photograph A Great Day in Harlem. Ware is best known for his work with the Thelonious Monk quartet in 1957-58. Ware and fellow bassist Israel Crosby were leading examples of the more laid-back \"Chicago Sound\" approach to the bass during the 1950s. He returned to Chicago in 1963, becoming largely inactive musically for a time. In 1969, Ware played with Clifford Jordan, Elvin Jones and Sonny Rollins.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lou_Donaldson> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Lou Donaldson (born November 1, 1926) is a jazz alto saxophonist. He was born in Badin, North Carolina. He is best known for his soulful, bluesy approach to playing the alto saxophone, although in his formative years he was, as many were of the bebop era, heavily influenced by Charlie Parker. Donaldson attended North Carolina A and T College in Greensboro in the early 1940s. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy during World War II and was trained at the Great Lakes bases in Chicago, where he was introduced to bop music in the lively club scene there. At the war's conclusion, he returned to Greensboro, where he worked club dates with the Rhythm Vets, a combo composed of A and T students who had served in the U.S. Navy. The band recorded the soundtrack to a musical comedy featurette, \"Pitch a Boogie Woogie,\" in Greenville, N.C. , in the summer of 1947. The movie had a limited run at black audience theatres in 1948 but its production company, Lord-Warner Pictures, folded and never made another film. \"Pitch a Boogie Woogie\" was subsequently restored by the American Film Institute in 1985 and re-premiered on the campus of East Carolina University in Greenville, NC the following year. Donaldson and the surviving members of the Vets performed a reunion concert after the film's showing. In the documentary made on \"Pitch\" by UNC-TV, \"Boogie in Black and White,\" Donaldson and his musical cohorts recall the film's making--Donaldson originally believed that he had played clarinet on the soundtrack. A short piece of concert footage from a gig in Fayetteville, NC is included in the documentary. Donaldson's first jazz recordings were with the Charlie Singleton Orchestra in 1950 and then with bop emissaries Milt Jackson and Thelonious Monk in 1952, and he participated in several small groups with other jazz luminaries such as trumpeter Blue Mitchell, pianist Horace Silver, and drummer Art Blakey. In 1953, he also recorded sessions with the trumpet virtuoso Clifford Brown, and Philly Joe Jones. He was a member of Art Blakey's Quintet and appeared on some of their best regarded albums, including the two albums recorded at Birdland in February 1954 Night at Birdland. Donaldson has recorded in the bop, hard bop, and soul jazz genres. For many years his pianist was Herman Foster. He will be inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame on October 11, 2012."@en .

His family sometimes spelled their last name \"Breaux\", pronounced \"Bro\". Born in St. James Parish, Louisiana, Braud came to New Orleans, in his early teens. He was playing violin and the upright bass and leading a trio in venues in the Storyville District before 1910. He moved to Chicago, Illinois in 1917. In 1923 he went to London with the Plantation Orchestra, in which he doubled on bass and trombone. Next he moved to New York City where he played with Wilber Sweatman's band before joining Duke Ellington. It has been noted by Branford Marsalis that Braud was the first to utilize the walking bass** style that has been a mainstay in modern jazz [opposed to the 'two-beat' pattern the tuba plays in the New Orleans style]. His vigorous melodic bass playing, alternately plucking, slapping, and bowing, was an important feature of the early Ellington Orchestra sound in the 1920s and 1930s. Braud's playing on Ellington's regular radio broadcasts and recordings helped popularize the slap style of string bass playing, as well as encouraging many dance bands of the time to switch from using a tuba to an Upright bass. (Like many of his contemporary New Orleans bassists, Braud doubled on tuba, and he recorded on that instrument on some sides with Ellington. ) In 1936 Braud co-managed a short lived Harlem club with Jimmie Noone, and recorded with the group Spirits of Rhythm from 1935 to 1937. He played with other New York bands including those of Kaiser Marshall, Hot Lips Page, and Sidney Bechet, and returned for a while to Ellington in 1944. In 1956 he joined the Kid Ory Band with whom he stayed for years. He is a distant relative of Branford Marsalis and Branford's brothers through their mother's side. He died in Los Angeles, California."@en .

Simon's fame, influence, and commercial success began as part of the duo Simon & Garfunkel, formed in 1964 with musical partner Art Garfunkel. Simon wrote most of the pair's songs, including three that reached No. 1 on the U.S. singles charts: \"The Sound of Silence\", \"Mrs. Robinson\", and \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\". The duo split up in 1970 at the height of their popularity, and Simon began a successful solo career as a guitarist and singer-songwriter, recording three highly acclaimed albums over the next five years. In 1986, he released Graceland, an album inspired by South African township music. Simon also wrote and starred in the film One-Trick Pony (1980) and co-wrote the Broadway musical The Capeman (1998) with the poet Derek Walcott. Simon has earned 12 Grammys for his solo and collaborative work, including the Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2001, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and in 2006 was selected as one of the \"100 People Who Shaped the World\" by Time magazine. Among many other honors, Simon was the first recipient of the Library of Congress's Gershwin Prize for Popular Song in 2007. In 1986 Simon was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Music degree from Berklee College of Music where he currently serves on the Board of Trustees."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dennis_Chambers> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Dennis Chambers (born May 9, 1959) is an American drummer who has recorded and performed with John Scofield, George Duke, Brecker Brothers, Santana, Parliament/Funkadelic, John McLaughlin, Niacin, Mike Stern, CAB, Greg Howe, and many others. Despite a lack of formal training, Chambers has become well known among drummers for his technique and speed. Chambers is particularly regarded for his ability to play \"in the pocket\" but can also stretch very far out of the pocket which is also a hallmark of his technique. Chambers exhibits a powerful style that is technically proficient, yet highly musical and groove-oriented. He can play in a wide variety of musical genres, but is perhaps most notable for his jazz-fusion, funk, and Latin music playing. He is mostly known for his fast hands and triplets on the bass drum. He has helped many young drummers, the most prominent being Tony Royster, Jr. In 2007, just before Led Zeppelin were scheduled to play at the O2 Arena in London, John Bonham's son Jason was asked in an interview that if he himself were to pass up the opportunity, which drummer would he recommend to fill the coveted drum throne. His reply was 'If I were to choose, I would probably want a jazz drummer with a strong swing feel. You know what - Dennis Chambers. I think he would \"get it\", whereas other rock drummers wouldn't. ' In an interview by Bonedo in 2011 Dennis Chambers was asked who some of his influences and favorite drummers were and he mentioned Clyde Stubblefield, Al Jackson, Steve Gadd, Vinnie Colaiuta, Garry Husband, Jack Dejonette, Billy Cobham, Buddy Rich, Elvin Jones, Roy Haines, and Tony Williams. He has been part of the Maceo Parker live band and is touring with Carlos Santana and makes appearances with his band Niacin. He plays Pearl drums, Zildjian cymbals, Zildjian sticks,and Evans drumheads. Chambers began drumming at the age of four years old, and was gigging in Baltimore-area nightclubs by the age of six. In 1978 (at 18 years old) he joined Parliament/Funkadelic, and stayed with them until 1985. In 1986 he joined the John Scofield band. Since then he has played with most of the major figures in jazz fusion music. On August 26, 2011 Chambers appeared as a featured drummer on the Late Show with David Letterman's Drum Solo Week II, alongside other such notable players as Tony Royster, Jr. , Gavin Harrison, Neil Peart and Stewart Copeland."@en .

In 1951 he began playing regularly again, touring with Buddy DeFranco, then worked with Jerry Wald, Tex Beneke, Elliot Lawrence, Stan Kenton, and Neal Hefti. His debut release as a leader, Wailing, was issued on Paramount Records in 1956; he did further work for the label with Phil Sunkel. Arnold's career was sporadic after the mid-1950s, due in no small part to continuing problems with drug addiction. In 1958, Arnold was imprisoned for attempted burglary, but returned in 1960 after his sentence ended to play with Kenton and Tommy Dorsey."@en .

He was one of the pioneers of the solid-body electric guitar, which made the sound of rock and roll possible. He is credited with many recording innovations. Although he was not the first to use the technique, his early experiments with overdubbing (also known as sound on sound), delay effects such as tape delay, phasing effects and multitrack recording were among the first to attract widespread attention. His innovative talents extended into his playing style, including licks, trills, chording sequences, fretting techniques and timing, which set him apart from his contemporaries and inspired many guitarists of the present day. He recorded with his wife Mary Ford in the 1950s, and they sold millions of records. Among his many honors, Paul is one of a handful of artists with a permanent, stand-alone exhibit in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He is prominently named by the music museum on its website as an \"architect\" and a \"key inductee\" along with Sam Phillips and Alan Freed."@en .

Through his works, he framed the African-American experience. His most famous book is The Middle Passage. Feelings was born and raised in Brooklyn, N.Y.. He attended the School of the Visual Arts and later lived in Ghana and Guyana. He was the recipient of a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. Tom Feelings was a skilled cartoonist. He created the groundbreaking comic strip Tommy Traveler In the World of Black History for the New York Age in 1958 after leaving the Air Force. Based on his own experience after discovering the adult section of the public library while researching a school project, Tommy Traveler is a black youth's dream adventures in American History while reading of notable black heroes. This material was released in book form in 1991. Another early piece was for Look magazine, doing portraits of children in New Orleans in 1962. Also about 1960 he illustrated the NAACP's four color comic for voter registration The Street Where You Live. Around 1968 he met Bertram Fitzgerald and he became one of the first contributors to his new line of black history comics with the umbrella title of Golden Legacy. According to Fitzgerald(*), at this time Feelings had done a previous biography of Crispus Attucks, the first casualty of the American Revolution, which was adapted into the Golden Legacy series. This may have been the 1968 Nobel Heritage publication, which shows some stylistic similarities to his art, but if so, it seems to have been inked by someone else.

He is widely known for his work with popular music during the Swing era. His name is inextricably linked to two of the most famous bandleaders of the time, Artie Shaw and Glenn Miller. Gray, along with Bill Finegan, wrote many of Glenn Miller's arrangements during the late 1930s and early 1940s. In the latter part of Grey's career, his orchestra served as the house band at the Venetian Room of the Fairmont Hotel, Dallas."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Machito> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Machito (born Francisco Ra\u00FAl Guti\u00E9rrez Grillo, February 16, 1908?\u2013April 19, 1984) was an influential Latin jazz musician who helped refine Afro-Cuban jazz and create both Cubop and salsa music. He was raised in Havana alongside the singer Graciela, his foster sister. In New York City, Machito formed the band the Afro-Cubans in 1940, and with Mario Bauz\u00E1 as musical director, brought together Cuban rhythms and big band arrangements in one group. He made numerous recordings from the 1940s to the 1980s, many with Graciela as singer. Machito changed to a smaller ensemble format in 1975, touring Europe extensively. He brought his son and daughter into the band, and received a Grammy Award in 1983, one year before he died. Machito's music had an effect on the lives of many musicians who played in the Afro-Cubans over the years, and on those who were attracted to Latin jazz after hearing him. George Shearing, Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker and Stan Kenton credited Machito as an influence. An intersection in East Harlem is named \"Machito Square\" in his honor."@en .

He also played the tuba and trumpet professionally. Foster was born to Charley and Annie Foster on a plantation near McCall in Ascension Parish near Baton Rouge in south Louisiana. His family moved to New Orleans when he was about ten years of age. His older brother, Willard Foster, began playing banjo and guitar; George started out on a cello then switched to string bass. Foster married twice: to Bertha Foster in 1912 and Alma Foster in 1936. Pops Foster was playing professionally by 1907 and worked with Jack Carey, Kid Ory, Armand Piron, King Oliver and other prominent hot bands of the era. In 1921 he moved to St. Louis to play with the Charlie Creath and Dewey Jackson bands, in which he would be active for much of the decade. He also joined Ory in Los Angeles. He acquired the nickname \"Pops\" because he was far older than any of the other players in the band. In 1929 Foster moved to New York City, where he played with the bands of Luis Russell and Louis Armstrong through 1940. He giged with various New York-based bands through the 1940s, including those of Sidney Bechet, Art Hodes, and regular broadcasts on the national This Is Jazz radio program. In the late 1940s he began touring more widely and played in many countries in Europe, especially in France, and throughout the United States including returns to New Orleans and California. In 1952, Foster toured Europe with Jimmy Archey's Band. He played regularly at Central Plaza in New York and briefly in New Orleans with Papa Celestin in 1954. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, he played with Earl Hines' Small Band. In 1966, he toured Europe with the New Orleans All-Stars but remained based in San Francisco, where he died. The Autobiography of Pops Foster was published in 1971, with a new edition in 2005 ISBN 0-87930-831-1 (alk. paper).

While he concentrated on theme-oriented albums of show tunes and traditional favorites during the 1960s, he began incorporating soft rock by the 1970s and remained a popular concert attraction well into the 1990s.

The left-handed virtuoso banjo player was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, the son of well regarded string bass player Henry Kimball. He was playing music professionally by the mid-1920s with such groups as the bands of Fate Marable and Papa Celestin. He married a fellow member of Celestin's Tuxedo Jazz Band, pianist Jeannette Kimball (n\u00E9e Salvant). In the 1930s during the Great Depression Kimball switched to string bass to play in swing bands such as Sidney Desvigne's, but music did not provide enough money; and he got a day job as a mailman. He continued playing music in the evening, leading his band called \"Narvin Kimball's Gentlemen of Jazz\". After World War II he formed a singing group called \"The Four Tones\" with Fred Minor, Alvin Alcorn, and Louis Barbarin that enjoyed some local success. With the revival of interest in traditional jazz, about 1960 was able to return to regularly play banjo professionally again. He played regularly at such French Quarter venues as Preservation Hall and Dixieland Hall, at the latter often leading a band under his own name. However he kept his day job as a postman until his retirement in 1973; until then he only took brief tours outside the city while on vacation from his postal job. After this date, he toured the United States and Europe extensively with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band. His singing \"Georgia on My Mind\" was a reliable show stopper. He was the oldest member of the band at his retirement in 1999 at age 90. When Hurricane Katrina was threatening New Orleans, in 2005, Preservation Hall leader Ben Jaffe made a point to make sure Kimball and his wife were evacuated to Baton Rouge.

Gershwin's compositions spanned both popular and classical genres, and his most popular melodies are widely known. Among his best known works are the orchestral compositions Rhapsody in Blue and An American in Paris, as well as the opera Porgy and Bess. Born in Brooklyn in 1898 to Jewish immigrant parents from Odessa, Ukraine (then part of the Russian Empire), Gershwin studied piano under Charles Hambitzer and composition with Rubin Goldmark and Henry Cowell. He began his career as a song plugger, but soon started composing Broadway theatre works with his brother Ira Gershwin and Buddy DeSylva. He moved to Paris to study with Nadia Boulanger, where he began to compose An American in Paris. After returning to New York City, he wrote Porgy and Bess with Ira and the author DuBose Heyward. Initially a commercial failure, Porgy and Bess is now considered one of the most important American operas of the twentieth century. Gershwin moved to Hollywood and composed numerous film scores until his death in 1937 from a brain tumor. Gershwin's compositions have been used in numerous films and on television, and several became jazz standards recorded in many variations. Countless singers and musicians have recorded his songs."@en .

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Masso did several recordings with Barbara Lea, Bob Haggart and Yank Lawson."@en .

She has hosted morning television shows Today and The View, the television news magazine 20/20, co-anchored the ABC Evening News, and is a contributor to ABC News. Walters first became known as a television personality when she was a writer and segment producer of \"women\u02BBs interest stories\" on the morning NBC News program The Today Show, where she began work with host Hugh Downs in 1962, once even modeling a swimsuit when an expected model did not show up. Because of her excellent interviewing ability and her popularity with the viewers, and when other women left the program, she was eventually allowed more air time. Even though her production duties made her a significant contributor to the show, she had no input in choosing a successor for Hugh Downs when he left the show in 1971. Frank McGee was hired. Although his salary was twice hers, at Frank McGee\u02BBs death in 1974, because of a clause added to her contract by her agent (a family friend), she acquired the title \"co-host\", the first woman by that title for any network news or public affairs program. Jim Hartz became her co-host. Two years later, continuing as a pioneer for women, she became the first female co-anchor of any network evening news, working with Harry Reasoner on the ABC News flagship program ABC Evening News. From 1979 to 2004, Walters worked 25 years as co-host and a producer for the ABC newsmagazine 20/20 (U.S. TV series). From 1976 to 2010, she contributed as an anchor, reporter, and correspondent for ABC News, along with producing and hosting her own special interview programs several times yearly. Beginning in 1997, she has created, and appears as co-host on, The View (U.S. TV series). In 1996, Walters was ranked #34 on the TV Guide \"50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time.\""@en .

Bigard was born in New Orleans to a family of Creoles of Color and studied music and clarinet with Lorenzo Tio. He moved to Chicago in the early 1920s, where he worked with Joe \"King\" Oliver and others. During this period, much of his recording with Oliver and others, including clarinetist Johnny Dodds, was on tenor saxophone, an instrument he played often with great lyricism, as on Oliver's hit recording of \"Someday Sweetheart\". In 1927 he joined Duke Ellington's band in New York, where he stayed until 1942. With Ellington, he was the featured clarinet soloist, while also doing some section work on tenor. After leaving Ellington's Orchestra, he moved to Los Angeles, California and did sound track work, including an onscreen featured role with an allstar band led by Louis Armstrong in the 1947 film New Orleans. He began working with trombonist Kid Ory's band during the late 1940s, and later worked with Louis Armstrong's touring band, the All Stars, and others. He appeared and played in the movie St. Louis Blues in 1958, with Nat King Cole, Ella Fitzgerald, Pearl Bailey and Eartha Kitt. He died in Culver City, California. Bigard wrote an autobiography entitled With Louis and The Duke, and he is credited as composer or co-composer on several numbers, notably the Ellington standard \"Mood Indigo\"."@en .

Fowlkes was born in New York, and studied alto and tenor saxophone, clarinet, and violin before settling on the baritone sax (he also played occasional flute). He spent most of his early career in New York, playing with Tiny Bradshaw (1938\u20131944), Lionel Hampton (1944\u20131948), and Arnett Cobb (1948\u20131951). This pattern of work was unusual for a jazz musician at the time; sidemen generally moved rapidly between bands, but Fowlkes had a sense of loyalty that kept him with bands for much longer periods. This was nowhere more evident than in his relationship with Count Basie. After joining Basie's orchestra in 1953, Fowlkes stayed with it until his death, with a short break in the 1940s for World War II (and the occasional absence occasioned by the career of his wife, the singer Wini Brown, whose manager he was). Fowlkes was the low-end foundation of the Basie band. Just listen to the Basie numbers, when Fowlkes was present, and you'll hear his low end presence---something that added importantly and richly to the Basied \"sound.\""@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Mingus> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Charles Mingus Jr. (April 22, 1922 \u2013 January 5, 1979) was a highly influential American jazz double bassist, composer and bandleader. Mingus's compositions retained the hot and soulful feel of hard bop and drew heavily from black gospel music while sometimes drawing on elements of Third Stream, free jazz, and classical music. Yet Mingus avoided categorization, forging his own brand of music that fused tradition with unique and unexplored realms of jazz. He once cited Duke Ellington and church as his main influences. Mingus focused on collective improvisation, similar to the old New Orleans jazz parades, paying particular attention to how each band member interacted with the group as a whole. In creating his bands, Mingus looked not only at the skills of the available musicians, but also their personalities. Many musicians passed through his bands and later went on to impressive careers. He recruited talented and sometimes little-known artists whom he assembled into unconventional and revealing configurations. As a performer, Mingus was a pioneer in double bass technique, widely recognized as one of the instrument's most proficient players. Nearly as well known as his ambitious music was Mingus' often fearsome temperament, which earned him the nickname \"The Angry Man of Jazz\". His refusal to compromise his musical integrity led to many on-stage eruptions, exhortations to musicians, and dismissals. Because of his brilliant writing for mid-size ensembles, and his catering to and emphasizing the strengths of the musicians in his groups, Mingus is often considered the heir of Duke Ellington, for whom he expressed great admiration. Indeed, Dizzy Gillespie had once claimed Mingus reminded him \"of a young Duke\", citing their shared \"organizational genius\". Mingus' music was once believed to be too difficult to play without Mingus' leadership. However, many musicians play Mingus compositions today, from the repertory bands Mingus Big Band, Mingus Dynasty, and Mingus Orchestra, to the high school students who play the charts and compete in the Charles Mingus High School Competition. Gunther Schuller has suggested that Mingus should be ranked among the most important American composers, jazz or otherwise. In 1988, a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts made possible the cataloging of Mingus compositions, which were then donated to the Music Division of the New York Public Library for public use. In 1993, The Library of Congress acquired Mingus's collected papers\u2014including scores, sound recordings, correspondence and photos\u2014in what they described as \"the most important acquisition of a manuscript collection relating to jazz in the Library's history\"."@en .

He also recorded under the names \"Pinewood Tom\" and \"Tippy Barton\" in the 1930s. White grew up in the Jim Crow South. During the 1920s and 1930s, he became a prominent race records artist, with a prolific output of recordings in genres including Piedmont blues, country blues, gospel, and social protest songs. In 1931, White moved to New York, and within a decade his fame had spread widely; his repertoire expanded to include urban blues, jazz, traditional folk songs, and political protest songs. He soon was in demand as an actor on radio, Broadway, and film. White also became the closest African-American friend and confidant to president Franklin D. Roosevelt. However, White's anti-segregationist and international human rights political stance presented in many of his recordings and in his speeches at rallies resulted in the right-wing McCarthyites assuming him a Communist. Accordingly, from 1947 through the mid-1960s, White became caught up in the anti-Communist Red Scare, and combined with the resulting attempt to clear his name, his career was damaged.

He was a pioneer in the genre of soul music during the 1950s by fusing rhythm and blues, gospel, and blues styles into his early recordings with Atlantic Records. He also helped racially integrate country and pop music during the 1960s with his crossover success on ABC Records, most notably with his Modern Sounds albums. While with ABC, Charles became one of the first African-American musicians to be given artistic control by a mainstream record company. Frank Sinatra called Charles \u201Cthe only true genius in show business,\u201D although Charles never believed that about himself. The influences upon his music were mainly jazz, blues, rhythm and blues and country artists of the day such as Art Tatum, Nat King Cole, Louis Jordan, Charles Brown, Louis Armstrong. His playing reflected influences from country blues, barrelhouse and stride piano styles. Rolling Stone ranked Charles number ten on their list of \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\" in 2004, and number two on their November 2008 list of \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time\". In honoring Charles, Billy Joel noted: \"This may sound like sacrilege, but I think Ray Charles was more important than Elvis Presley."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Cage> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Not to be confused with John Cale. John Milton Cage Jr. (September 5, 1912 \u2013 August 12, 1992) was an American composer, music theorist, writer, and artist. A pioneer of indeterminacy in music, electroacoustic music, and non-standard use of musical instruments, Cage was one of the leading figures of the post-war avant-garde. Critics have lauded him as one of the most influential American composers of the 20th century. He was also instrumental in the development of modern dance, mostly through his association with choreographer Merce Cunningham, who was also Cage's romantic partner for most of their lives. Cage is perhaps best known for his 1952 composition 4\u203233\u2033, which is performed in the absence of deliberate sound; musicians who present the work do nothing aside from being present for the duration specified by the title. The content of the composition is not \"four minutes and 33 seconds of silence,\" as is sometimes assumed, but rather the sounds of the environment heard by the audience during performance. The work's challenge to assumed definitions about musicianship and musical experience made it a popular and controversial topic both in musicology and the broader aesthetics of art and performance. Cage was also a pioneer of the prepared piano (a piano with its sound altered by objects placed between or on its strings or hammers), for which he wrote numerous dance-related works and a few concert pieces. The best known of these is Sonatas and Interludes (1946\u201348). His teachers included Henry Cowell (1933) and Arnold Schoenberg (1933\u201335), both known for their radical innovations in music, but Cage's major influences lay in various East and South Asian cultures. Through his studies of Indian philosophy and Zen Buddhism in the late 1940s, Cage came to the idea of aleatoric or chance-controlled music, which he started composing in 1951. The I Ching, an ancient Chinese classic text on changing events, became Cage's standard composition tool for the rest of his life. In a 1957 lecture, Experimental Music, he described music as \"a purposeless play\" which is \"an affirmation of life \u2013 not an attempt to bring order out of chaos nor to suggest improvements in creation, but simply a way of waking up to the very life we're living\"."@en .

Smith had a radio, television, and recording career spanning five decades, which reached its pinnacle in the 1940s. Smith was born in Greenville, Virginia. Her professional musical career began in 1930, when she was discovered by Columbia Records vice president Ted Collins, who became her longtime partner and manager. Collins put her on radio in 1931. She sang the controversial top twenty song of 1931, \"That's Why Darkies Were Born\". She appeared in 1932 in Hello Everybody!, with co-stars Randolph Scott and Sally Blane, and in the 1943 wartime movie This is the Army she sang \"God Bless America\". Smith began recording in 1926; in 1931, she sang \"Dream a Little Dream of Me. \" Her biggest hits were \"River, Stay 'Way From My Door\" (1931), \"The Woodpecker Song\" (1940), \"The White Cliffs of Dover\" (1941), \"Rose O'Day\" (1941), \"Last Time I saw Paris\" (1942), \"I Don't Want to Walk Without You\" (1942), \"There Goes That Song Again\" (1944), \"Seems Like Old Times\" (1946), and \"Now Is the Hour\" (1947). Her theme song was \"When the Moon Comes Over the Mountain\"; she had helped write the lyrics. Smith greeted her audience with \"Hello, everybody!\" and signed off with \"Thanks for listenin'. \" Her feature film Hello, Everybody (1932) was released shortly before Mae West's She Done Him Wrong (1933). At this time, Paramount Pictures was in deep financial trouble. Paramount initially promoted Smith's film and it proved to be disappointing at the box office. On the other hand, West's first starring film was a huge success. This situation added to the ridicule of Smith's size and appearance, but she was featured in a number of Paramount shorts without issue. She continued to be successful on radio throughout the 1930s into the 1940s."@en .

Before he became President, Carter, a Democrat, served as a U.S. Naval officer, was a peanut farmer, served two terms as a Georgia State Senator and one as Governor of Georgia (1971\u20131975). During Carter's term as President, he created two new cabinet-level departments: the Department of Energy and the Department of Education. He established a national energy policy that included conservation, price control, and new technology. In foreign affairs, Carter pursued the Camp David Accords, the Panama Canal Treaties, the second round of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT II), and returned the Panama Canal Zone to Panama. He took office during a period of international stagflation, which persisted throughout his term. The end of his presidential tenure was marked by the 1979\u20131981 Iran hostage crisis, the 1979 energy crisis, the Three Mile Island nuclear accident, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the United States boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow (the only U.S. boycott in Olympic history), and the eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington state. By 1980, Carter's popularity had eroded. He survived a primary challenge against Ted Kennedy for the Democratic Party nomination in the 1980 election, but lost the election to Ronald Reagan, the Republican candidate. On January 20, 1981, minutes after Carter's term in office ended, the 52 U.S. captives held at the U.S. embassy in Iran were released, ending the 444-day Iran hostage crisis. After leaving office, Carter and his wife Rosalynn founded the Carter Center in 1982, a nongovernmental, not-for-profit organization that works to advance human rights. He has traveled extensively to conduct peace negotiations, observe elections, and advance disease prevention and eradication in developing nations.

He signed with Dot Records in 1955 and released several albums as a leader in the second half of the 1950s.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cole_Porter> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Cole Albert Porter (June 9, 1891 \u2013 October 15, 1964) was an American composer and songwriter. Born to a wealthy family in Indiana, he defied the wishes of his domineering grandfather and took up music as a profession. Classically trained, he was drawn towards musical theatre. After a slow start, he began to achieve success in the 1920s, and by the 1930s he was one of the major songwriters for the Broadway musical stage. Unlike most successful Broadway composers, Porter wrote both the lyrics and the music for his songs. After a serious horseback riding accident in 1937, Porter was left disabled and in constant pain, but he continued to work. His shows of the early 1940s did not contain the lasting hits of his best work of the 1920s and 30s, but in 1948 he made a triumphant comeback with his most successful musical, Kiss Me, Kate. It won the first Tony Award for best musical. Porter's other musicals include Fifty Million Frenchmen, DuBarry Was a Lady, Anything Goes, Can-Can and Silk Stockings. His numerous hit songs include \"Night and Day\", \"I Get a Kick Out of You\", \"Well, Did You Evah!\", \"I've Got You Under My Skin\", \"My Heart Belongs to Daddy\" and \"You're the Top\". He also composed scores for films from the 1930s to the 1950s, including Born to Dance (1936), which featured the songs \"You'd Be So Easy to Love\" and \"I've Got You Under My Skin\"; Rosalie (1937), which featured \"In the Still of the Night\"; High Society (1956), which included \"True Love\"; and Les Girls(1957)."@en .

He was the first person appointed to the Vice Presidency under the terms of the 25th Amendment, after Spiro Agnew had resigned. When he became President upon Richard Nixon's resignation on August 9, 1974, he became the first and to date only person to have served as both Vice President and President of the United States without being elected by the Electoral College. Before ascending to the Vice Presidency, Ford served nearly 25 years as the Representative from Michigan's 5th congressional district, eight of them as the Republican Minority Leader. As President, Ford signed the Helsinki Accords, marking a move toward d\u00E9tente in the Cold War. With the conquest of South Vietnam by North Vietnam nine months into his presidency, U.S. involvement in Vietnam essentially ended. Domestically, Ford presided over the worst economy in the four decades since the Great Depression, with growing inflation and a recession during his tenure. One of his more controversial acts was to grant a presidential pardon to President Richard Nixon for his role in the Watergate scandal. During Ford's incumbency, foreign policy was characterized in procedural terms by the increased role Congress began to play, and by the corresponding curb on the powers of the President. In 1976, Ford narrowly defeated Ronald Reagan for the Republican nomination, but lost the presidential election to Democrat Jimmy Carter. Following his years as president, Ford remained active in the Republican Party. After experiencing health problems, Ford died in his home on December 26, 2006. Ford lived longer than any other U.S. president, living 93 years and 165 days, while his 895-day presidency remains the shortest of all Presidents who did not die in office."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Al_Jolson> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Al Jolson (born Asa Yoelson) (May 26, 1886 \u2013 October 23, 1950) was an American singer, comedian, and actor of Jewish descent. In his heyday, he was dubbed \"The World's Greatest Entertainer\". His performing style was brash and extroverted, and he popularized a large number of songs that benefited from his \"shamelessly sentimental, melodramatic approach\". Numerous well-known singers were influenced by his music, including Bing Crosby Judy Garland, rock and country entertainer Jerry Lee Lewis, and Bob Dylan, who once referred to him as \"somebody whose life I can feel\". Broadway critic Gilbert Seldes compared him to the Greek god Pan, claiming that Jolson represented \"the concentration of our national health and gaiety. \" In the 1930s, he was America's most famous and highest-paid entertainer. Between 1911 and 1928, Jolson had nine sell-out Winter Garden shows in a row, more than 80 hit records, and 16 national and international tours. Although he's best remembered today as the star of the first (full-length) talking movie, The Jazz Singer in 1927, he later starred in a series of successful musical films throughout the 1930s. After a period of inactivity, his stardom returned with the 1946 Oscar-winning biographical film The Jolson Story. Larry Parks played Jolson, with the songs dubbed in with Jolson\u2019s real voice. A sequel, Jolson Sings Again, was released in 1949 and was nominated for three Academy Awards. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Jolson became the first star to entertain troops overseas during World War II, and again in 1950 became the first star to perform for GIs in Korea, doing 42\u00A0shows in 16\u00A0days. He died just weeks after returning to the U.S. , partly owing to the physical exertion of performing. Defense Secretary George Marshall afterward awarded the Medal of Merit to Jolson's family. According to the St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture, \"Jolson was to jazz, blues, and ragtime what Elvis Presley was to rock 'n' roll. \" Being the first popular singer to make a spectacular \"event\" out of singing a song, he became a \u201Crock star\u201D before the dawn of rock music. His specialty was performing on stage runways extending out into the audience. He would run up and down the runway and across the stage, \"teasing, cajoling, and thrilling the audience,\" often stopping to sing to individual members; all the while the \"perspiration would be pouring from his face, and the entire audience would get caught up in the ecstasy of his performance. \" According to music historian Larry Stempel, \"No one had heard anything quite like it before on Broadway. \" Author Stephen Banfield agreed, writing that Jolson's style was \"arguably the single most important factor in defining the modern musical.... \" He enjoyed performing in blackface makeup, a theatrical convention since the mid 19th century. With his unique and dynamic style of singing black music, such as jazz and blues, he was later credited with single-handedly introducing African-American music to white audiences. As early as 1911 he became known for fighting against anti-black discrimination on Broadway. Jolson's well-known theatrics and his promotion of equality on Broadway helped pave the way for many black performers, playwrights, and songwriters, including Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Fats Waller, and Ethel Waters."@en .

Known for his surrealist films, he has developed his own unique cinematic style, which has been dubbed \"Lynchian\", a style characterized by its dream imagery and meticulous sound design. The surreal, and in many cases, violent, elements contained within his films have been known to \"disturb, offend or mystify\" audiences. Born to a middle-class family in Missoula, Montana, Lynch spent his childhood traveling around the United States, before going on to study painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia, where he first made the transition to producing short films. Deciding to devote himself more fully to this medium, he moved to Los Angeles, where he produced his first motion picture, the surrealist horror Eraserhead (1977). After Eraserhead became a cult classic on the midnight movie circuit, Lynch was employed to direct The Elephant Man (1980), from which he gained mainstream success. Then being employed by the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group, he proceeded to make two films: the science-fiction epic Dune (1984), which proved to be a critical and commercial failure, and then a neo-noir crime film, Blue Velvet (1986), which was critically acclaimed. Next, Lynch created his own television series with Mark Frost, the highly popular murder mystery Twin Peaks (1990\u20131991); he also created a cinematic prequel, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (1992), a road movie, Wild at Heart (1990), and a family film, The Straight Story (1999) in the same period. Turning further towards surrealist filmmaking, three of his subsequent films operated on \"dream logic\", non-linear narrative structures: Lost Highway (1997), Mulholland Drive (2001) and Inland Empire (2006). Meanwhile, Lynch embraced the internet as a medium, producing several web-based shows, such as the animation Dumbland (2002) and the surreal sitcom Rabbits (2002). Over his career, Lynch has received three Academy Award nominations for Best Director and a nomination for best screenplay. Lynch has twice won France's C\u00E9sar Award for Best Foreign Film, as well as the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and a Golden Lion award for lifetime achievement at the Venice Film Festival. The French government awarded him the Legion of Honor, the country's top civilian honor, as a Chevalier in 2002 and then an Officier in 2007, while that same year, The Guardian described Lynch as \"the most important director of this era\".

A cultural icon, he is commonly known by the single name Elvis. {{#invoke:Footnotes|sfn}} One of the most popular musicians of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the \"King of Rock and Roll\" or \"the King\". Born in Tupelo, Mississippi, Presley moved to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family at the age of 13. He began his career there in 1954, working with Sun Records owner Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, Presley was the most important popularizer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country and rhythm and blues. RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who went on to manage the singer for over two decades. Presley's first RCA single, \"Heartbreak Hotel\", released in January 1956, was a number-one hit. He became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll with a series of network television appearances and chart-topping records. His energized interpretations of songs, many from African-American sources, and his uninhibited performance style made him enormously popular\u2014and controversial. In November 1956, he made his film debut in Love Me Tender. Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He staged few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood movies and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, after seven years away from the stage, he returned to live performance in a celebrated comeback television special that led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of profitable tours. In 1973 Presley staged the first concert broadcast globally via satellite, Aloha from Hawaii. Prescription drug abuse severely deteriorated his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at the age of 42. Presley is regarded as one of the most important figures of 20th-century popular culture. He had a versatile voice and unusually wide success encompassing many genres, including country, pop ballads, gospel, and blues. He is the best-selling solo artist in the history of popular music. {{#invoke:Footnotes|sfn}}{{#invoke:Footnotes|sfn}}{{#invoke:Footnotes|sfn}}{{#invoke:Footnotes|sfn}} Nominated for 14 competitive Grammys, he won three, and received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36.

He is also known for his work as a bandleader and music educator. He is most notable for his associations with the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra and the Count Basie Orchestra. The son of two jazz enthusiasts, Mackrel started playing the drums at age two, bought his first drum set at age five, and began his professional career playing at a community theater at age ten. He attended the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, studying jazz under Frank Gagliardi, during which time he performed in venues such as the Imperial Palace and the Tropicana. In 1981, Mackrel moved to New York City and became a drummer with a Broadway theatre orchestra. Two years later, singer Joe Williams invited him to join the Count Basie Orchestra, where Mackrel would remain until December 1987. He was the last drummer of that orchestra to be personally hired by Count Basie himself. Mackrel frequently performed as a substitute drummer in the Mel Lewis Jazz Orchestra. Shortly before Lewis died in February 1990, he announced that he wanted Mackrel to take his place as the regular drummer for the band, which soon changed its name to the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra. Mackrel later became the drummer for other big bands, including his own Manhattan Symphony Jazz Orchestra. In September 2010, he returned to the Count Basie Orchestra as its director after the retirement of trombonist Bill Hughes. As a composer and arranger, Mackrel has received a Grant for Composition from the National Endowment for the Arts (1983). He has written pieces for McCoy Tyner, the WDR Radio Big Band of Cologne, the Kl\u00FCvers Big Band of Denmark, and the RIAS Big Band of Berlin."@en .

Classically trained, Taylor is generally acknowledged as one of the pioneers of free jazz. His music is characterized by an extremely energetic, physical approach, producing complex improvised sounds, frequently involving tone clusters and intricate polyrhythms. His piano technique has been likened to percussion, for example described as \"eighty-eight tuned drums\" (referring to the number of keys on a standard piano). He has also been compared to \"Art Tatum with contemporary-classical leanings.\""@en .

His performing career was relatively short and, in comparison to other musicians of his generation, Gryce's work is little known. However, several of his compositions have been covered extensively (\"Minority,\" \"Social Call,\" \"Nica's Tempo\") and have become minor jazz standards. Gryce's compositional bent includes harmonic choices similar to those of contemporaries Benny Golson, Tadd Dameron and Horace Silver. Gryce's playing, arranging, and composing are most associated with the classic hard bop era (roughly 1953\u20131965). He retired from music in the early 1960s, due primarily to frustration with the financial side of his career."@en .

Harry Fox made a few recordings of popular songs and appeared in a few silent films, most notably the serial Beatrice Fairfax with Olive Thomas. In the early sound era he made some talking short films such as \"Harry Fox and his American Beauties\" and \"The Fox and the Bee\" (with his partner and wife Beatrice) but by the 1930s his fame was over and he lived a life of obscurity getting work in films playing bit parts while holding a job as a tester in an aircraft plant. In the 1920s he was briefly married to one of the famous Ziegfeld performers The Dolly Sisters. He was still living in 1945 when the biopic The Dolly Sisters was made. The movie shows the marriage happening during World War I, a subsequent divorce, and a reunion after Jenny Dolly's accident."@en .

Primarily a dancer and singer, he was also known for his impersonations of actors and other celebrities. Davis started as a child vaudevillian who became known for his performances on Broadway and Las Vegas, Nevada. He went on to become a world famous recording artist, television and film star. Davis was also a member of Frank Sinatra's \"Rat Pack\". At the age of three Davis began his career in vaudeville with his father and Will Mastin as the Will Mastin Trio, toured nationally, and after military service, returned to the trio. Davis became an overnight sensation following a nightclub performance at Ciro's after the 1951 Academy Awards. With the trio, he became a recording artist. In 1954, he lost his left eye in an automobile accident. His film career began as a child in 1933. In 1960 he appeared in the first Rat Pack film, Ocean's 11. After a starring role on Broadway in 1956's Mr Wonderful, Davis returned to the stage in 1964's Golden Boy, and in 1966 had his own TV variety show, The Sammy Davis Jr. Show. Davis' career slowed in the late sixties, but he had a hit record with \"The Candy Man\", in 1972, and became a star in Las Vegas earning him the nickname Mister Show Business. As an African American, Davis was the victim of racism throughout his life and was a large financial supporter of civil rights causes. Davis had a complex relationship with the African-American community and attracted criticism after physically embracing Richard M. Nixon in 1972. One day on a golf course with Jack Benny, he was asked what his handicap was. \"Handicap?\" he asked. \"Talk about handicap \u2014 I'm a one-eyed Negro Jew. \" This was to become a signature comment, recounted in his autobiography, and in countless articles. After reuniting with Sinatra and Dean Martin in 1987, Davis toured with them and Liza Minnelli internationally, before he died of throat cancer in 1990. He died in debt to the Internal Revenue Service, and his estate was the subject of legal battles. Davis was awarded the Spingarn Medal by the NAACP and was nominated for a Golden Globe and an Emmy Award for his television performances. He was the recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors in 1987, and in 2001, he was posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award."@en .

He is best known as guitarist, vocalist, and principal songwriter of The Velvet Underground, and for his solo career, which has spanned several decades. Though the Velvet Underground were a commercial failure in the late 1960s, the group has gained a considerable cult following in the years since its demise and has gone on to become one of the most widely cited and influential bands of the era. As the Velvet Underground's principal songwriter, Reed wrote about subjects of personal experience that rarely had been examined so openly in rock and roll, including sexuality and drug culture. After his departure from the group, Reed began a solo career in 1971. He had a hit the following year with \"Walk on the Wild Side\", although he subsequently lacked the mainstream commercial success its chart status seemed to indicate. Reed's work as a solo artist frustrated critics wishing for a return of the Velvet Underground. In 1975, Reed released a double album of feedback loops, Metal Machine Music, upon which he later commented, \"No one is supposed to be able to do a thing like that and survive. \" In 2008, Reed married performance artist Laurie Anderson."@en .

Several top hits such as \"Rags to Riches\" followed in the early 1950s. Bennett then further refined his approach to encompass jazz singing. He reached an artistic peak in the late 1950s with albums such as The Beat of My Heart and Basie Swings, Bennett Sings. In 1962, Bennett recorded his signature song, \"I Left My Heart in San Francisco\". His career and his personal life then suffered an extended downturn during the height of the rock music era. Bennett staged a remarkable comeback in the late 1980s and 1990s, putting out gold record albums again and expanding his audience to the MTV Generation while keeping his musical style intact. He remains a popular and critically praised recording artist and concert performer in the 2010s.

He is the founder of what is probably the best-known jazz festival in the United States, the Newport Jazz Festival, which is held every summer in Newport, Rhode Island. He also co-founded the Newport Folk Festival with Pete Seeger and Theodore Bikel. Wein was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1925, the son of Dr. and Mrs. Barnet M. Wein, both his parents were ethnically Jewish. A graduate of Newton High School, Wein was a jazz pianist in his youth and while studying at Boston University led a small group which played professionally around the Boston area. After serving in the army during World War II, he graduated from Boston University's College of Liberal Arts in 1950 (Larry Josephs, \"Boston Beat,\" Jewish Advocate, 9 September 1954, p. \u00A02; \"George Wein Named Honorary Newport Citizen,\" Jewish Advocate, 4 August 1966, p. \u00A04). That same year, he opened a jazz club called Storyville and established a Storyville record label. He also began to teach a course at Boston University on the history of jazz. In 1954 Newport residents Louis and Elaine Lorillard invited him to organize a festival in their hometown of Newport, Rhode Island, with funding to be provided by them; the subsequent festival was the first outdoor jazz festival in the United States, and became an annual tradition in Newport. Wein went on to start a number of festivals in other cities, including the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and the Playboy Jazz Festival in Los Angeles, and also established the Newport Folk Festival. In the 60s he set up Festival Productions, a company dedicated to promoting large-scale jazz events. Wein pioneered the idea of corporate sponsorship for his events, and his \"Schlitz Salute to Jazz\" and \"Kool Jazz Festival\" were the first Jazz events to feature title sponsors, Schlitz beer and Kool cigarettes. Festival Productions' feature event is now called \"the JVC Jazz Festival at Newport\", and the company runs JVC Jazz Festivals in cities around including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Paris, Warsaw, and Tokyo. Other title sponsors of Festival Productions events include Mellon Bank, Essence Magazine, Verizon, Ben & Jerry's, and Dunkin' Donuts.

As such, he was a model for Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Art Tatum and his more famous pupil, Fats Waller. Johnson composed many hit tunes including the theme song of the Roaring Twenties, \"Charleston\" and \"If I Could be With You One Hour Tonight\" and remained the acknowledged king of New York jazz pianists until he was dethroned c. 1933 by the recently arrived Art Tatum, who is widely acknowledged by jazz critics as the most technically proficient jazz pianist of all time. Johnson's artistry, his significance in the subsequent development of jazz piano, and his large contribution to American musical theatre, are often overlooked, and as such, he has been referred to by Reed College musicologist David Schiff, as \"The Invisible Pianist\"."@en .

Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, he led several big bands in the United States and abroad. His orchestra was at Harlem's Smalls' Paradise in 1925 when a Russian impresario booked it as the pit band for a show titled, The Chocolate Kiddies, scheduled to open in Berlin later that year, featuring music by Duke Ellington starring the performers Lottie Gee and Adelaide Hall. While in Berlin, the band, which featuring such musicians as Doc Cheatham, Willie Lewis, Tommy Ladnier, Gene Sedric, and Herb Flemming, recorded several selections for the Vox label. In 1929, with slightly different personnel, Wooding's orchestra made more recordings in Barcelona and Paris for the Parlophone and Path\u00E9 labels. Wooding did return to America in 1934. On 14 February 1934, Wooding and his orchestra were featured at the Apollo theatre in Harlem in a Clarence Robinson production titled 'Chocolate Soldiers' starring the Broadway star Adelaide Hall. The show ran for a limited engagement and was highly praised by the press and helped establish the Apollo as Harlem's premier theatre. It was the first major production staged at the newly renovated theatre. Wooding returned to Europe, performing on the Continent, in Russia and England throughout most of the 1930s. Wooding's long stays overseas made him virtually unknown at home, but Europeans were among the staunchest jazz fans anywhere, and they loved what the band had to offer. \"We found it hard to believe, but the Europeans treated us with as much respect as they did their own symphonic orchestras,\" he recalled in a 1978 interview. \"They loved our music, but they didn\u2019t quite understand it, so I made it a load easier for them by incorporating such melodies as \"Du holder Abendstern\" from Tannh\u00E4user - syncopated, of course. They called it blasphemy, but they couldn\u2019t get enough of it. That would never have happened back here in the States. Here they looked on jazz as something that belonged in the gin mills and sporting houses, and if someone had suggested booking a blues singer like Bessie Smith, or even a white girl like Nora Baes, on the same bill as Ernestine Schumann-Heink, it would have been regarded as a joke in the poorest of taste. \" Returning home in the late 1930s, when World War II seemed a certainty, Wooding began formal studies of music, attained a degree, and began teaching full-time, counting among his students trumpeter Clifford Brown. He also led and toured with the Southland Spiritual Choir. In the early 1970s, Sam Wooding formed another big band and took it to Switzerland for a successful concert, but this venture was short-lived."@en .

He oversaw Bing Crosby's rise to success as a recording artist in the early 1930s; four decades later, Crosby still gave appreciation to Kapp for diversifying his song catalogue into various styles and genres, saying, \"I thought he was crazy, but I just did what he told me. \" Kapp could not read or sing music, but to his talent he stressed the credo, \"Where's the melody?\" Kapp's father became a distributor for Columbia Records in 1905, and opened the Imperial Talking Machine Shop in Chicago. Kapp worked at the store after high school, and was known for having memorized the catalog numbers of every record in the inventory as well as the addresses and phone numbers of his father's best customers. After marrying his childhood sweetheart Frieda Lutz in 1922, he opened the Kapp Record Store with his younger brother, Dave Kapp. In 1926, Kapp joined Brunswick Records and was put in charge of their \"race\" label (Brunswick 7000 and Vocalion Records 1000 series), where he scouted, signed or produced artists including, King Oliver, Jelly Roll Morton, Pinetop Smith, Leroy Carr, Frankie Jaxon, and Cow Cow Davenport, among others. Kapp also worked with artists on the Brunswick label; it was over the company's objection that he had Al Jolson record \"Sonny Boy\"; the song became a huge success for Jolson. The artists signed by Kapp included Crosby, Cab Calloway, the Mills Brothers, the Boswell Sisters, and Mildred Bailey. Kapp sold Brunswick's British franchises to stockbroker Edward R. Lewis, who owned the English Decca Company. Two years later, when a deal to buy Columbia Records fell through, the pair instead started Decca Records. Crosby's deal with Brunswick had an escape clause that allowed him to follow Kapp to the new company. Other artists followed, including the Mills Brothers, Boswell Sisters, Earl Hines, Ted Lewis, Isham Jones and the Dorsey Brothers. Kapp also signed new performers such as Chick Webb, Art Tatum, Jimmie Lunceford, Ethel Waters, and a year after the company's founding, Louis Armstrong. Dave Kapp was instrumental in building the company's extensive hillbilly catalogue, allowing Decca to corner the market on country music for years. Record sales had plunged during the Depression, and Kapp decided that Decca discs would sell for 50 cents instead of the usual 75 cents to a dollar. When Brunswick shifted its back catalogue to a 25-cent subsidiary label in an effort to sink the fledgling company, Kapp further reduced the price to 35 cents per disc. Crucially, he also pursued the then-new jukebox market. In 1938, Decca began releasing record sleeves with cover artwork; other innovations such as liner notes and Broadway cast albums followed (although Jack Kapp pioneered this practice in 1933 by recording the entire \"Blackbirds of 1928\" and \"Showboat\" scores and issuing them in album sets). By 1939, the company was on its feet; 18 million of the 50 million records sold in the United States that year were issued by Decca. After Kapp's death, his brother Dave took over American Decca. Dave Kapp later founded Kapp Records, based in New York."@en .

Although he has performed and recorded as a tenor saxophonist, Holman is best known as an arranger. Through his acquaintance with Gene Roland, Holman was auditioned by Stan Kenton and hired as a tenor sax player around 1951. Kenton was apparently attracted to Holman's ability to integrate counterpoint and dissonance in subtle yet distinctive ways, and for his knack for making the usually unswinging Kenton band \"swing\" in its own particular fashion. Holman became Kenton's chief arranger, and wrote much of Kenton's 1950s repertoire; including one of Kenton's finest albums, Contemporary Concepts. He continued to write for Kenton, on and off, throughout the 1960s and 70s. In addition to his work for Kenton, Holman has provided charts for Woody Herman, Doc Severinsen, Buddy Rich, Terry Gibbs, Count Basie, Gerry Mulligan's Concert Jazz Band and others. He formed his own California-based band in 1975 and continues to perform with it in the U.S. and worldwide. His 1997 recording Brilliant Corners/The Music of Thelonious Monk won a Grammy award. in 1969, Ella Fitzgerald recorded \"Give Me the Simple Life\" with Holman's arrangement on her live album Sunshine of Your Love. Bill Holman is also credited with brass arrangements on The Fifth Dimension's 1969 album, The Age of Aquarius. He received his honorary doctorate through Elmhurst College of Illinois."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Zorn> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "John Zorn (born September 2, 1953 in New York City) is an American avant-garde composer, arranger, record producer, saxophonist and multi-instrumentalist. Zorn is a prolific artist; he has hundreds of album credits as performer, composer, or producer. He has had experience with a variety of genres including jazz, rock, hardcore punk, classical, extreme metal, klezmer, film, cartoon, popular, and improvised music. Zorn brings these styles to his work, which he refers to with the label avant-garde/experimental. Zorn has stated: \"All the various styles are organically connected to one another. I'm an additive person - the entire storehouse of my knowledge informs everything I do. People are so obsessed with the surface that they can't see the connections, but they are there. \" Zorn has led the punk jazz band Naked City and the klezmer-influenced quartet Masada, composed Masada Songbooks (written concert music for classical ensembles), and has produced music for film and documentary. Zorn established himself within the New York City downtown music movement in the mid-1970s and has since composed and performed with a wide range of musicians working in diverse musical areas. By the early 1990s Zorn was working extensively in Japan, attracted by that culture's openness about borrowing and remixing ingredients from elsewhere, before returning to New York as a permanent base in the mid-1990s. Zorn has undertaken many tours of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, often performing at festivals with varying ensembles to display his diverse output. After releasing albums on several independent US and European labels, Zorn signed with Elektra Nonesuch and attracted wide acclaim in 1985 when he released The Big Gundown, a cover of music composed by Ennio Morricone. He attracted further attention worldwide by following this with the release of Spillane in 1987, and Naked City by Naked City in 1989. Zorn then recorded on the Japanese DIW label and curated the Avant subsidiary label before forming Tzadik in 1995, where he was prolific in issuing several new recordings each year as well as releasing the work of many other musicians."@en .

To evade the political persecution of artists in the McCarthy era, Scott moved to Paris in the late 1950s and performed in France, not returning to the United States until 1967. Born in Port of Spain, Hazel was taken at the age of four by her mother to New York.

Rushing was known as \"Mr. Five by Five\" and was the subject of an eponymous 1942 popular song that was a hit for Harry James and others\u2014the lyrics describing Rushing's rotund build: \"he's five feet tall and he's five feet wide\". He joined Walter Page's Blue Devils in 1927, then joined Bennie Moten's band in 1929. He stayed with the successor Count Basie band when Moten died in 1935. Rushing was a powerful singer who had a range from baritone to tenor. He could project his voice so that it soared over the horn and reed sections in a big-band setting. Basie claimed that Rushing \"never had an equal\" as a blues vocalist. George Frazier, author of Harvard Blues, called Rushing's distinctive voice \"a magnificent gargle\". His best known recordings are probably \"Going to Chicago\" with Basie, and \"Harvard Blues\", with a famous saxophone solo by Don Byas."@en .

As a teenager he left home to work as a dancer with a burlesque road show, the Brownskin Models, but soon settled in New Orleans, where he worked as a singer in the Dew Drop Inn. In 1949 he was signed up by Fred Mendelsohn for the Regal label in New Jersey. His first two recordings, \"I'll Get Along Somehow\" and \"For You My Love\", both hit the R&B charts in November 1949, with \"For You My Love\", written by Paul Gayten, staying at the # 1 spot for eight weeks. The follow-ups \"I Love My Baby\" and Louis Prima's \"Oh Babe!\" were also hits, and Darnell's powerful and passionate voice contributed to the development of a trend in popular music soon marketed nationwide as rock and roll. However, after Regal collapsed in 1951, his records became less successful. By now known as \"Mr. Heart & Soul\", he appeared in the 1955 movie Harlem Rock & Roll Revue, and spent the rest of the decade recording for various labels, gradually fading from the scene. In 1969 he made his final recordings, for the Instant label in New Orleans. Receding from professional activity, he continued to sing in church and at charitable events. In 1979 he was mugged, receiving severe injuries. The doctors operating on him to save his life discovered he had lung cancer, from which he died in 1983."@en .

While Dave Brubeck (1920\u20132012) and Paul Desmond (1924\u20131977), became world jazz celebrities, the musician responsible for establishing their partnership was American tenor saxophonist, composer and arranger David van Kriedt. http://www. puredesmond. ca/bru-91. htm David was born in Berkeley, California, USA. He spent three years at Mills College in Oakland, California, studying composition with Darius Milhaud (1892\u20131974), and formed, with fellow students, The Jazz Workshop Ensemble. Later they became known as The Eight and subsequently the Dave Brubeck Octet. Mills College in 1946 was where eight young music students recorded Dave Brubeck's Curtain Music, the personnel for the Octet was, Brubeck \u2013 Piano; Paul Desmond - Alto Saxophone; Dave Van Kriedt - Tenor Saxophone; Bill Smith - Clarinet; Dick Collins - Trumpet; Bob Collins - Trombone; Jack Weeks - Bass; Cal Tjader - Drums. The octet played only a few concerts in three years, as club owners were scared by the advanced non-commercial music. In three years at both San Francisco State and Mills College, van Kriedt became proficient in voice and practically every instrument. In 1950 with the same personnel, The Octet recorded an album that today is as fresh and exciting to hear as it was then. Van Kriedt was the most influential contributor to The Octet, both composing the majority of originals and arranging the standards for it. In fact in 1951 when Russian Composer Igor Stravinsky was lecturing at U.C.L.A. , he used van Kriedt\u2019s composition \u2018Fugue on Bop Themes\u2019 to demonstrate to students the true art of counterpoint. In 1950 Van Kriedt, Brubeck and wife Iola and their sons, Cal Tjader; Jack Weeks (bassist), all relocated to Honolulu for some time before going their own separate ways once again. In 1948 while still a Mills College student, van Kriedt ventured to France, where he recorded with Kenny Clarke\u2019s Be Bop Minstrels. The music on this recording was listed under best album of the year. Van Kriedt fitted in very well with the exciting Paris Jazz scene, and had the opportunity to jam with Guitarist Django Reinhardt. While in Europe, van Kriedt traveled to Norway to meet some family members and learnt that his maternal Grandfather, Ollie Clausen, an Organist had given music lessons to none other than Edvard Grieg (1843 \u20131907). Returning to Mills College in 1952 as an outstanding academic, van Kriedt won first prize in Graduate Composition."@en .

Although she could swing as strongly as any straight-ahead jazz artist, Horn's reputation rode on her exquisite ballad work."@en .

Ellington wrote over 1,000 compositions. In the opinion of Bob Blumenthal of The Boston Globe, \"[i i]n the century since his birth, there has been no greater composer, American or otherwise, than Edward Kennedy Ellington. \" A major figure in the history of jazz, Ellington's music stretched into various other genres, including blues, gospel, film scores, popular, and classical. His career spanned more than 50 years and included leading his orchestra, composing an inexhaustible songbook, scoring for movies, composing stage musicals, and world tours. Several of his instrumental works were adapted into songs that became standards. Due to his inventive use of the orchestra, or big band, and thanks to his eloquence and extraordinary charisma, he is generally considered to have elevated the perception of jazz to an art form on a par with other traditional genres of music. His reputation increased after his death and the Pulitzer Prize Board bestowed on him a special posthumous honor in 1999. Ellington called his music \"American Music\" rather than jazz, and liked to describe those who impressed him as \"beyond category\". These included many of the musicians who were members of his orchestra, some of whom are considered among the best in jazz in their own right, but it was Ellington who melded them into one of the best-known jazz orchestral units in the history of jazz. He often composed specifically for the style and skills of these individuals, such as \"Jeep's Blues\" for Johnny Hodges, \"Concerto for Cootie\" for Cootie Williams, which later became \"Do Nothing Till You Hear from Me\" with Bob Russell's lyrics, and \"The Mooche\" for Tricky Sam Nanton and Bubber Miley. He also recorded songs written by his bandsmen, such as Juan Tizol's \"Caravan\" and \"Perdido\" which brought the \"Spanish Tinge\" to big-band jazz. Several members of the orchestra remained there for several decades. After 1941, he frequently collaborated with composer-arranger-pianist Billy Strayhorn, whom he called his \"writing and arranging companion\". Ellington recorded for many American record companies, and appeared in several films. Ellington led his band from 1923 until his death in 1974. His son Mercer Ellington, who had already been handling all administrative aspects of his father's business for several decades, led the band until his own death in 1996. At that point, the original band dissolved. Paul Ellington, Mercer's youngest son and executor of the Duke Ellington estate, kept the Duke Ellington Orchestra going from Mercer's death onwards."@en .

Musicians who played in the band include Lionel Hampton, Marshall Royal, Lawrence Brown, Britt Woodman, Joe Wilder, T-Bone Walker, and Dizzy Gillespie. Hite rarely recorded, and for this reason much of the details of his life and work are poorly documented. The only sessions he did were 14 numbers recorded between 1940 and 1942."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ziggy_Elman> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Harry Aaron Finkelman (May 26, 1914 \u2013 June 26, 1968), better known by the stage name Ziggy Elman, was an American jazz trumpeter most associated with Benny Goodman, though he also led his own Ziggy Elman and His Orchestra. He was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but his family settled in Atlantic City when he was four. His father was a violinist who had hoped Harry would play violin as well. Although he did learn to play the violin, Harry preferred the brass instruments. He began playing for Jewish weddings and nightclubs at age 15, and in 1932 made his first recording where he played trombone. At some point in the decade he adopted the name Ziggy Elman. Elman is a shortening of Finkelman while \"Ziggy\" is believed to be a reference to Florenz Ziegfeld. In 1936 Elman joined the Benny Goodman orchestra as a trumpet player after playing briefly with Alex Bertha's local big band at Steel Pier in Atlantic City, where Goodman heard him and was impressed. His 1939 composition \"And the Angels Sing,\" with lyrics by Johnny Mercer, (originally recorded in December 1938 by his own band as an instrumental, \"Frailach In Swing\") became the number one song in the nation. In 1956 he was asked to recreate his famous frailach solo along with the original vocalist Martha Tilton for the movie, The Benny Goodman Story, but was unable to, his technique having since withered away. Elman appeared performing it in the film, but another trumpeter, Manny Klein, played the solo on the soundtrack. This song is arguably his longest-lasting musical legacy, since it has appeared in films up to 1997 and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1987. After his work with Goodman, Elman joined Tommy Dorsey's band and also played as a member of the military during the war. He loved frailach music, later known as klezmer, and made a few recordings of such with Mickey Katz. In the period from 1940 to 1947 he was honored in DownBeat Magazine Readers Poll six times. http://www. downbeat. com/artists/artist_main. asp?sect=archives&aid=713&aname=Down+Beat+Readers+Poll He led his own bands starting in 1947. By the 1950s big bands had declined and for a time he switched to entertainment work. In this decade he appeared in films mostly as himself. In 1956 he had a heart attack, curtailing his music career. By the end of the 1950s he was financially ruined and had to work for a car dealership. In 1961 it was revealed at an alimony hearing that he was virtually bankrupt. He later worked in a music store and taught trumpet to some up-and-coming musicians. He died in 1968 at 54 and was buried at Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles."@en .

Ellington arranged many of his pieces to showcase Stewart's half-valve effects, muted sound, and forceful style. Stewart co-wrote \"Boy Meets Horn\" and \"Morning Glory\" while with Ellington, and frequently supervised outside recording sessions by members of the Ellington band. After eleven years Stewart left to lead his own groups - \" little swing bands, that were a perfect setting for his solo playing. \" He also toured Europe and Australia with Jazz at the Philharmonic from 1947 to 1951. From the early 1950s on he worked in radio and television and published highly regarded jazz criticism. The book Jazz Masters of the Thirties is a selection of his criticism. Rex also wrote for Playboy, Downbeat and several other print outlets during his life. He lived in upstate New York after purchasing a 100+ year old farmhouse. He hosted a jazz radio program in Troy, New York and owned a small restaurant for a very short time near a drag racing stadium in Vermont.

The music videos for his songs, including those of \"Beat It,\" \"Billie Jean,\" and \"Thriller,\" were credited with breaking down racial barriers and transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool. The popularity of these videos helped to bring the then relatively new television channel MTV to fame. With videos such as \"Black or White\" and \"Scream\" he continued to innovate the medium throughout the 1990s, as well as forging a reputation as a touring solo artist. Through stage and video performances, Jackson popularized a number of complicated dance techniques, such as the robot, and the moonwalk, to which he gave the name. His distinctive sound and style has influenced numerous hip hop, post-disco, contemporary R&B, pop, and rock artists. Jackson's 1982 album Thriller is the best-selling album of all time. His other records, including Off the Wall (1979), Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991), and HIStory (1995), also rank among the world's best-selling. Jackson is one of the few artists to have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice. He was also inducted into the Dance Hall of Fame as the first and only dancer from pop and rock music. Some of his other achievements include multiple Guinness World Records; 13 Grammy Awards as well as the Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award; 26 American Music Awards, more than any other artist, including the \"Artist of the Century\" and \"Artist of the 1980s\"; 13 number-one singles in the United States in his solo career, more than any other male artist in the Hot 100 era; and the estimated sale of over 400\u00A0million records worldwide. Jackson won hundreds of awards, which made him the most-awarded recording artist in the history of popular music. In what would have been Jackson's 52nd birthday on 29 August 2010, he became the most downloaded artist of all time. Jackson constantly traveled the world attending events honoring his humanitarianism and the 2000 Guinness Book of Records recognized him for supporting 39 charities. Aspects of Jackson's personal life, including his changing appearance, personal relationships, and behavior, generated controversy. In the mid-1990s, he was accused of child sexual abuse, but the case was settled out of court for about $25 million and $2 million and no formal charges were brought. In 2005, he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges after the jury found him not guilty on all counts. While preparing for his concert series titled This Is It, Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication on June 25, 2009, after suffering from cardiac arrest. The Los Angeles County Coroner ruled his death a homicide, and his personal physician was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Jackson's death triggered a global outpouring of grief and a live broadcast of the public memorial service viewed around the world. In March 2010, Sony Music Entertainment and Jackson's estate signed the largest music contract ever, with a $250 million deal to retain distribution rights to his recordings until 2017, and to release seven posthumous albums over the decade following his death."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nellie_Lutcher> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Nellie Lutcher (October 15, 1912 \u2013 June 8, 2007) was an African-American R&B and jazz singer and pianist, who gained prominence in the late 1940s and early 1950s. She was most recognizable for her diction and exaggerated pronunciation, and was credited as an influence by Nina Simone among others. She was born in Lake Charles, Louisiana, the eldest daughter of the 15 children of Isaac and Suzie Lutcher. Her father was a bass player, and her mother a church organist. She received piano lessons, and her father formed a family band with Nellie playing piano. At age 12, she played with Ma Rainey, when Rainey's regular pianist fell ill and had to be left behind in the previous town. Searching for a temporary replacement in Lake Charles, one of the neighbors told her there was a little girl who played in church who might be able to do it. Aged 14, Lutcher joined her father in Clarence Hart's Imperial Jazz Band, and in her mid-teens also briefly married the band's trumpet player. In 1933, she joined the Southern Rhythm Boys, writing their arrangements and touring widely. In 1935, she moved to Los Angeles, where she married Leonel Lewis and had a son. She began to play swing piano, and also to sing, in small combos throughout the area, and began developing her own style, influenced by Earl Hines, Duke Ellington and her friend Nat \"King\" Cole. She was not widely known until 1947 when she learned of the March of Dimes talent show at Hollywood High School, and performed. The show was broadcast on the radio and her performance caught the ear of Dave Dexter, a scout for Capitol Records. She was signed by Capitol and made several records, including \"The One I Love Belongs To Someone Else\" and her first hit single, the risqu\u00E9 \"Hurry On Down\", which went to # 2 on the rhythm and blues chart. This was followed by her equally successful composition \"He's A Real Gone Guy\", which also made # 2 on the R&B chart and crossed over to the pop charts where it reached # 15. In 1948 she had a string of further R&B chart hits, the most successful being \"Fine Brown Frame\", her third # 2 R&B hit. Her songs charted on the pop, jazz, and R&B charts, she toured widely and became widely known. She wrote many of her own songs and, unlike many other African-American artists of the period, retained the valuable publishing rights to them. In 1950, Lutcher duetted with Nat \"King\" Cole on \"For You My Love\" and \"Can I Come in for a Second\". The same year, her records began to be released in the UK and were actively promoted by radio DJ Jack Jackson. She headlined a UK variety tour, compered by Jackson, with great success, later returning there to tour on her own. With an orchestra for the first time, Lutcher recorded \"The Birth of the Blues\" and \"I Want to Be Near You\" in 1951, but she was losing her appeal with the record-buying public and Capitol dropped her the following year. She went on to record, much less successfully, for other labels including Okeh, Decca and Liberty, and gradually wound down her performance schedule. By 1957, she had joined the board of the Los Angeles Musicians Union, but continued to perform occasionally until the 1990s under the management of Alan Eichler, with many successful engagements including the Cookery and Michael's Pub in New York, the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel's Cinegrill in Los Angeles and the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. She also starred in her own TV special \"Nellie\" on PBS and recorded a one-hour concert with Marian McPartland for the NPR series Piano Jazz. She invested successfully in property and managed her own apartment building in the Crenshaw area of Los Angeles. She was the sister of saxophonist Joe \"Woodman\" Lutcher and aunt of Latin jazz percussionist Daryl \"Munyungo\" Jackson and singer Jacqueline Levy."@en .

He led his own jazz ensemble in Atlantic City by 1919, and played in the bands of Charlie Johnson and Sam Wooding. He then moved to Detroit and played with Hank Duncan and Roland Smith. After returning to Toledo, he played gigs with June Clark and James P. Johnson, and followed this with a stint in New York City with Fess Williams. In 1924, June Clark took over leadership of Harrison's ensemble, though he continued to perform in it. In 1925 he began working with Billy Fowler, where he remained for several years.

Blanton is credited with being the originator of more complex pizzicato and arco bass solos in a jazz context than previous bassists. Born in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Blanton originally learned to play the violin, but took up the bass while at Tennessee State University, performing with the Tennessee State Collegians from 1936 to 1937, and during the vacations with Fate Marable. After leaving university to play full time in St Louis with the Jeter-Pillars Orchestra (with whom he made his first recordings), he joined Duke Ellington's band in 1939. Though he stayed with Ellington for only two years, Blanton made an incalculable contribution in changing the way the double bass was used in jazz. Previously the double bass was rarely used to play anything but quarter notes in ensemble or solos but by soloing on the bass more in a 'horn like' fashion, Blanton began sliding into eighth- and sixteenth-note runs, introducing melodic and harmonic ideas that were totally new to jazz bass playing. His virtuosity put him in a different class from his predecessors, making him the first true master of the jazz bass and demonstrating the instrument's unsuspected potential as a solo instrument. Such was his importance to Ellington's band at the time, together with the tenor saxophonist Ben Webster, that it became known as the Blanton\u2013Webster band. Blanton also recorded a series of bass and piano duets with Ellington In 1941, Blanton was diagnosed with tuberculosis, cutting short his tenure with Ellington. His last recording session was cut on September 26, 1941 in Hollywood. Blanton died the following year after retiring to a sanatorium in California, aged 23."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gerry_Mulligan> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Gerald Joseph \"Gerry\" Mulligan (April 6, 1927 \u2013 January 20, 1996) was an American jazz saxophonist, clarinetist, composer and arranger. Though Mulligan is primarily known as one of the leading baritone saxophonists in jazz history \u2013 playing the instrument with a light and airy tone in the era of cool jazz \u2013 he was also a notable arranger, working with Claude Thornhill, Miles Davis, Stan Kenton, and others. Mulligan's pianoless quartet of the early 1950s with trumpeter Chet Baker is still regarded as one of the more important cool jazz groups. Mulligan was also a skilled pianist and played several other reed instruments. Mulligan reportedly had a relationship with actress Judy Holliday until she died in 1965, and with actress Sandy Dennis from 1965 through 1973. In 1974 Mulligan met his future wife, Countess Franca Rota Borghini Baldovinetti, in Milan, Italy."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marky_Markowitz> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Irvin \"Marky\" Markowitz (December 11, 1923 - November 18, 1986) was an American jazz trumpeter. Markowitz played early in his career in a number of big bands, including those of Charlie Spivak (1941-42), Jimmy Dorsey, Boyd Raeburn, and Woody Herman (1946). He played in Buddy Rich's orchestra in 1946-47, then returned to service under Herman in 1947-48. He worked primarily as a studio musician in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, and some live appearances included work with Gene Krupa (1958), Herman and Lee Konitz (1959), Ralph Burns, George Russell, Al Cohn (1962), Paul Desmond (1969), and Bill Evans (1974). Marky was a \"first call\" trumpeter for many top artists of the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, including Simon and Garfunkel, Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, the Young Rascals, Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Dionne Warwick, Maynard Ferguson, and many others, as well as hundreds of advertising \"jingles\" and TV ads. He was a perennial on the Jerry Lewis Labor Day Telethon for Muscular Dystrophy, and known for a \"sweet\" tone on the trumpet and flugelhorn, as well as a better-than-average vocal impression of Louis \"Satchmo\" Armstrong, which was featured on a 1970's TV commercial for Hecker's Flour. He led only one recording session, for the Famous Door label in 1976."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marilyn_Monroe> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Marilyn Monroe (born Norma Jeane Mortenson; June 1, 1926 \u2013 August 5, 1962) was an American actress, model, and singer, who became a major sex symbol, starring in a number of commercially successful motion pictures during the 1950s and early 1960s. After spending much of her childhood in foster homes, Monroe began a career as a model, which led to a film contract in 1946 with Twentieth Century-Fox. Her early film appearances were minor, but her performances in The Asphalt Jungle and All About Eve (both 1950), drew attention. By 1952 she had her first leading role in Don't Bother to Knock and 1953 brought a lead in Niagara, a melodramatic film noir that dwelt on her seductiveness. Her \"dumb blonde\" persona was used to comic effect in subsequent films such as Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953), How to Marry a Millionaire (1953) and The Seven Year Itch (1955). Limited by typecasting, Monroe studied at the Actors Studio to broaden her range. Her dramatic performance in Bus Stop (1956) was hailed by critics and garnered a Golden Globe nomination. Her production company, Marilyn Monroe Productions, released The Prince and the Showgirl (1957), for which she received a BAFTA Award nomination and won a David di Donatello award. She received a Golden Globe Award for her performance in Some Like It Hot (1959). Monroe's last completed film was The Misfits (1961), co-starring Clark Gable with screenplay by her then-husband, Arthur Miller. The final years of Monroe's life were marked by illness, personal problems, and a reputation for unreliability and being difficult to work with. The circumstances of her death, from an overdose of barbiturates, have been the subject of conjecture. Though officially classified as a \"probable suicide\", the possibility of an accidental overdose, as well as of homicide, have not been ruled out. In 1999, Monroe was ranked as the sixth-greatest female star of all time by the American Film Institute. In the decades following her death, she has often been cited as both a pop and a cultural icon as well as the quintessential American sex symbol. In 2009, TV Guide Network named her #1 in Film's Sexiest Women of All Time."@en .

While he had an impressive career as a pianist and arranger, he is best known in retrospect for his bebop arrangements. Born in New York City, Handy first worked professionally as a swing pianist for Michael Loring in 1938, but soon was drafted into the United States Army in 1940. From 1944 \u2013 1946 he became a member of the Boyd Raeburn Orchestra, composing and performing on piano. This was during a time when many big bands were transforming their musical tendencies toward bebop. He did leave the orchestra briefly to do work for Paramount Studios, but returned to Raeburn quickly. During this period he entered one of his most creative periods, doing arrangements of older standards with a distinctly bebop quality. Just as he was entering his prime, however, he had a falling out with Raeburn and left the group. While he continued to arrange for other musicians in his later career, it is that 1944 \u2013 1946 period for which he is remembered most."@en .

Born into a large family from Charlemagne, Quebec, Dion emerged as a teen star in the French-speaking world after her manager and future husband Ren\u00E9 Ang\u00E9lil mortgaged his home to finance her first record. In 1990, she released the English-language album Unison, establishing herself as a viable pop artist in North America and other English-speaking areas of the world. Dion had first gained international recognition in the 1980s by winning both the 1982 Yamaha World Popular Song Festival and the 1988 Eurovision Song Contest where she represented Switzerland. Following a series of French albums in the early 1980s, she signed on to CBS Records Canada in 1986. During the 1990s, with the help of Ang\u00E9lil, she achieved worldwide fame after signing with Epic Records and releasing several English albums along with additional French albums, becoming one of the most successful artists in pop music history. However, in 1999 at the height of her success, Dion announced a hiatus from entertainment in order to start a family and spend time with her husband, who had been diagnosed with cancer. She returned to the top of pop music in 2002 and signed a three-year (later extended to almost five years) contract to perform nightly in a five-star theatrical show at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace, Paradise, Nevada. Dion's music has been influenced by genres ranging from rock and R&B to gospel and classical. While her releases have often received mixed critical reception, she is renowned for her technically skilled and powerful vocals. Dion is the best-selling Canadian artist of all time, is the second best-selling female artist in the US during the Nielsen SoundScan era, and is the only female artist to have two singles sell more than a million copies in the UK. In addition, her 1995 album D'eux, is the best-selling French-language album of all time. In 2004, after surpassing 175 million in album sales worldwide, she was presented with the Chopard Diamond Award at the World Music Awards for becoming the best-selling female artist of all time.

He is best known for his role in the advancement of civil rights using nonviolent civil disobedience. King has become a national icon in the history of American progressivism. A Baptist minister, King became a civil rights activist early in his career. He led the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott and helped found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in 1957, serving as its first president. With the SCLC, King led an unsuccessful struggle against segregation in Albany, Georgia, in 1962, and organized nonviolent protests in Birmingham, Alabama, that attracted national attention following television news coverage of the brutal police response. King also helped to organize the 1963 March on Washington, where he delivered his \"I Have a Dream\" speech. There, he established his reputation as one of the greatest orators in American history. He also established his reputation as a radical, and became an object of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's COINTELPRO for the rest of his life. FBI agents investigated him for possible communist ties, recorded his extramarital liaisons and reported on them to government officials, and on one occasion, mailed King a threatening anonymous letter that he interpreted as an attempt to make him commit suicide. On October 14, 1964, King received the Nobel Peace Prize for combating racial inequality through nonviolence. In 1965, he and the SCLC helped to organize the Selma to Montgomery marches and the following year, he took the movement north to Chicago. In the final years of his life, King expanded his focus to include poverty and the Vietnam War, alienating many of his liberal allies with a 1967 speech titled \"Beyond Vietnam\". King was planning a national occupation of Washington, D.C. , called the Poor People's Campaign. King was assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee. His death was followed by riots in many U.S. cities. Allegations that James Earl Ray, the man convicted of killing King, had been framed or acted in concert with government agents persisted for decades after the shooting, and the jury of a 1999 civil trial found Loyd Jowers to be complicit in a conspiracy against King. King was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day was established as a U.S. federal holiday in 1986. Hundreds of streets in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor. A memorial statue on the National Mall was opened to the public in 2011."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stanley_Dance> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Stanley Dance (September 15, 1910, Braintree, Essex \u2013 23 February 1999, Escondido, California) was a jazz writer and oral historian of the swing era. He began writing about the jazz scene for the French magazine Jazz Hot in 1935. In 1937, he visited New York City's jazz scene for three weeks with Helen Oakley, whom he married in 1946, and resided in England until moving to Connecticut in 1959. He wrote for Jazz Journal from 1948 until his death in 1999. In the 1950s he coined the term mainstream to describe those in between revivalist and modern, or alternatively between Dixieland and bebop. He is credited with helping to revive the career of pianist Earl Hines in 1964. He also contributed liner notes for numerous musicians including Duke Ellington and Count Basie. In 1964 he was co-winner of the first Grammy Award for Best Album Notes. He was inducted into the Big Band and Jazz Hall of Fame in 1999, the year of his death, and posthumously received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Jazz Journalist Association. His distaste for bebop, and most innovations in jazz after it, made him controversial. That said, he is admired for having been a champion of what he did like, as well as a significant collator of oral history in several books containing the recollections of swing era musicians. Emerging from the popularity of Dixieland and preceding the post-World War II domination of Bebop, there was the Swing Era, a fertile period that many enthusiasts claim to be the pinnacle of Jazz. Stanley Dance, was a jazz critic and historian that certainly advocated this position. His close kinship with the great musicians of the 20th century led to insightful oral histories, published in Jazz Journal International, JazzTimes, Down Beat, the bilingual Jazz Hot, and many others. Often traveling with the bands, he recorded the musicians\u2019 words, letting them speak for themselves. Although most closely associated with Duke Ellington and his talented orchestra (he delivered the eulogy at Duke Ellington's funeral), Stanley Dance endorsed all jazz music and musicians that swung. In 1959, the inseparable team of Stanley and Helen Oakley Dance had moved with their four young children from Stanley's home in Braintree, Essex in England to the New York City suburb of Rowayton, CT, leaving his conventional career and beloved natural family behind. For the next 40 years, he followed his heart, dedicating himself to his extended family; the music and musicians he loved. He fulfilled diverse roles such as serving as an Artist & Repertoire (A&R) coordinator at recording sessions; managing Earl Hines\u2019 career from its resurgence in 1964 which he helped orchestrate; writing Grammy award winning album liner notes, compiling Duke Ellington\u2019s autobiography \"Music is my Mistress\" (sadly out of print at this time), and writing eight books. Mr. Dance wrote the liner notes for the Decca release \"Early Ella: Great Ballads by Ella Fitzgerald. It was in the late 1960s that Stanley Dance was awarded a book contract with Charles Scribner\u2019s Sons. \"The World of Duke Ellington\" was published in 1970 to critical acclaim. In 1974, the first book in his trilogy of \"The World of Swing\" was issued under the same name. Columbia Records complemented its release with a double album containing his personal selections. He continued his series with \"The World of Earl Hines\" in 1977 and \"The World of Count Basie\" in 1980. Except for \"The World of Earl Hines\", these hallmark texts, documenting the experiences and insights of these great band leaders and their sidemen in their own words, are still available in paperback editions through Da Capo Press. Dance died on February 23, 1999, at the age of 88, briefly after retiring as book editor at Jazz Times. His interment was located in Mission San Luis Rey Cemetery."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Baker_(composer)> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "David Nathaniel Baker Jr. is an American symphonic jazz composer at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music in Bloomington. Born in Indianapolis, Indiana, David Baker attended Crispus Attucks High School. He was educated at Indiana University, receiving both his Undergraduate and Masters in Music Education from that institution. He thrived in the Indianapolis jazz scene of the time, serving as a mentor of sorts to Indianapolis-born trumpeter Freddie Hubbard. Originally a talented trombonist, he was forced to abandon that instrument after a jaw injury left him unable to play (although he played brilliantly on the George Russell Sextet album Ezz-thetics after sustaining the injury). Following the injury, he learned to play cello, a rare instrument in the jazz world. This shift to cello largely ended his career as a performer and marked a period of increased interest in composition and pedagogy. Among the first and most important people to begin to codify the then largely aural tradition of jazz he wrote several seminal books on jazz, including Jazz Improvisation. As an educator he has helped make Indiana a highly regarded destination for students of music. Probably the best known students to pass under his tutelage are Michael Brecker, Randy Brecker, Peter Erskine, Jim Beard, Chris Botti, Jeff Hamilton, and the jazz-education mogul Jamey Aebersold. A 1973 Pulitzer Prize nominee, Mr. Baker has been nominated for a Grammy Award (1979), honored three times by Down Beat magazine (as a trombonist, for lifetime achievement, and most recently as the third inductee to their jazz Education Hall of Fame), and has received the National Association of jazz Educators Hall of Fame Award (1981), President\u2019s Award for Distinguished Teaching (1986) from Indiana University, the Arts Midwest jazz Masters Award (1990), and the Governor\u2019s Arts Award of the State of Indiana (1991). His compositional works are often cited as examples of the Third Stream Jazz movement, although they run the gamut from traditional jazz compositions intended for improvisation, to through-composed symphonic works. He has written over 2,000 compositions. Mr. Baker has been commissioned by more than 500 individuals and ensembles, including Josef Gingold, Ruggerio Ricci, Janos Starker, Harvey Phillips, the New York Philharmonic, St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, Beaux Arts Trio, Fisk jubilee Singers, Louisville Symphony, Ohio Chamber Orchestra, the Audubon String Quartet, and the International Horn Society. His compositions, tallying over 2,000 in number, range from jazz and sonatas to film scores. He has recently received a lot of attention for his \"Concertino for Cell Phones and Orchestra\", premiered in Chicago in October 2006, with a European premiere in Dvorak Hall, Prague, Czech Republic. A dedicated music educator as well as composer and performer, Mr. Baker\u2019s involvement in music organizations has encompassed membership on the National Council on the Arts; board positions for the American Symphony Orchestra League, Arts Midwest, and the Afro-American Bicentennial Hall of Fame/Museum; and past chairs of the Jazz Advisory Panel to the Kennedy Center and the jazz/Folk/Ethnic Panel of the NEA. He is a past president of the International Association of jazz Educators, and is currently president of the National jazz Service Organization and senior consultant for music programs for the Smithsonian Institution. He has more than 65 recordings, 70 books, and 400 articles to his credit. Pianist Monika Herzig of Indiana University wrote a book about David Baker. David Baker: A Legacy in Music was published in 2011 by Indiana University Press."@en .

Royal was born in Oklahoma, the elder brother of trumpeter Ernie Royal, and learned to play violin, guitar, as well as clarinet and sax while still a child. He first performed in public at the age of thirteen, starting his professional career with an eight-year stint with Les Hite's band (1931\u20131939), during which time he also recorded with Art Tatum. He spent 1940 to 1942 with Lionel Hampton, until the war interrupted his career. After his military service (during which he played in a Navy band), Royal played with Eddie Heywood, then went on to work in studios in Los Angeles, California. In 1951 Royal replaced Buddy DeFranco as clarinettist with Count Basie's septet, which Basie had formed after circumstances forced him to dissolve his big band. When the Basie band was reformed the following year, Royal stayed on as lead alto saxophonist and as music director \u2014 not to leave until 1970. Though he was admired as an occasional soloist, his main r\u00F4le was as an important part of the reeds section, and as a leader who helped to give Basie's sound its distinctively precise yet swinging character. When he left Basie in 1970, Royal settled permanently in Los Angeles, continuing to play and record, working with Bill Berry's big band, Frank Capp and Nat Pierce, Earl Hines, and Duke Ellington. Royal recorded as a soloist with Dave Frishberg in 1977, and with Warren Vache in 1978. He co-led a band with Snooky Young in the 1970s and 1980s, recording with it in 1978, and with Ella Fitzgerald and Gene Harris, among others. In 1989 he took the lead alto chair with Frank Wess's big band."@en .

He performed and recorded with the James P. Johnson orchestra, King Oliver, Fats Waller and the Luis Russell orchestra, among others. In the late 1930s, Archey participated in big bands that simultaneously featured musicians such as Benny Carter, Coleman Hawkins, Cab Calloway, Duke Ellington and Claude Hopkins.

Miles Davis once said, \"You can tell the history of jazz in four words: Louis Armstrong. Charlie Parker. \" Parker acquired the nickname \"Yardbird\" early in his career and the shortened form, \"Bird\", which continued to be used for the rest of his life, inspired the titles of a number of Parker compositions, such as \"Yardbird Suite\", \"Ornithology\", \"Bird Gets the Worm\", and \"Bird of Paradise. \" Parker was a highly influential jazz soloist and a leading figure in the development of bebop, a form of jazz characterized by fast tempos, virtuosic technique, and improvisation. Parker introduced revolutionary harmonic ideas, including rapid passing chords, new variants of altered chords, and chord substitutions. His tone ranged from clean and penetrating to sweet and somber. Many Parker recordings demonstrate his virtuoso playing style and complex melodic lines, sometimes combining jazz with other musical genres, including blues, Latin, and classical. Parker was an icon for the hipster subculture and later the Beat Generation, personifying the jazz musician as an uncompromising artist and intellectual, rather than an entertainer."@en .

Weckl attended Francis Howell High School in St. Charles, MO and graduated in 1978. He majored in jazz studies at the University of Bridgeport in Connecticut. Starting out on the New York fusion scene in the early 1980s, Weckl soon found himself working with artists such as Paul Simon, Madonna, George Benson, Michel Camilo, Robert Plant and Anthony Jackson. His most famous early work though, where his popularity blossomed, was with the Chick Corea Elektric Band from 1985 to 1991. Weckl spent a total of seven years with Corea, during which he performed on numerous albums and also appeared with Corea's Akoustic Band. He augmented his work with Corea by continuing his session work and appearing often with the GRP All-Star Big Band.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ringo_Starr> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Richard Starkey, MBE (born 7 July 1940) commonly known by his stage name Ringo Starr, is an English musician and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles. When the band formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool band, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. He joined the Beatles in August 1962, taking the place of Pete Best. In addition to his drumming, Starr is featured on lead vocals on a number of successful Beatles songs. He is credited as a co-writer of the songs \"What Goes On\", \"Flying\", and \"Dig It\" and as the sole writer of \"Don't Pass Me By\" and \"Octopus's Garden\". As a musically creative drummer for the Beatles, Starr's contribution to their music has received high praise from notable drummers. Starr described himself as \"your basic offbeat drummer with funny fills\". Drummer Steve Smith said that Starr's popularity \"brought forth a new paradigm\" where \"we started to see the drummer as an equal participant in the compositional aspect\" and that Starr \"composed unique, stylistic drum parts for the Beatles' songs\". In 2011, Starr was picked as the fifth-best drummer of all-time by Rolling Stone readers. Starr is the most documented and critically acclaimed actor among the Beatles, playing a central role in several of their films, and appearing in numerous other films, both during and after his career with them. After their break-up in 1970, Starr achieved solo musical success with several singles and albums, and recorded with each of his fellow ex-Beatles as they too developed their post-Beatle musical careers. He has also been featured in a number of TV documentaries, hosted TV shows, narrated the first two series of the children's television series Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends and portrayed \"Mr. Conductor\" during the first season of the PBS children's television series Shining Time Station. Since 1989, Starr has toured with twelve variations of Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band."@en .

His style became more chromatic and astringent with time, but was always essentially tonal, relying heavily on polyphony. Mennin's fifth symphony of 1950, which is tonal, energetic and suspenseful, was recorded by Howard Hanson and the Eastman Rochester Orchestra in the Mercury series of American classical works. His work received renewed attention in the CD era, and now all his symphonies have been recorded (except for the withdrawn #1 and #2).

Often billed as America's Number One Song Stylist, his other nicknames include Mr. Rhythm, Old Leather Lungs, and Mr. Steel Tonsils. His hits included \"That's My Desire\", \"That Lucky Old Sun\", \"Mule Train\", \"Cry of the Wild Goose,\" \"Jezebel\", \"High Noon\", \"I Believe\", \"Hey Joe!\", \"The Kid's Last Fight\", \"Cool Water\", \"Moonlight Gambler,\" \"Love Is a Golden Ring,\" \"Rawhide\", and \"Lord, You Gave Me a Mountain. \" He sang well-known theme songs for many movie Western soundtracks, including 3:10 To Yuma, Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, and Blazing Saddles, although he was not a country & western singer. Laine sang an eclectic variety of song styles and genres, stretching from big band crooning to pop, western-themed songs, gospel, rock, folk, jazz, and blues. He did not sing the soundtrack song for High Noon, which was sung by Tex Ritter, but his own version (with somewhat altered lyrics, omitting the name of the antagonist, Frank Miller) was the one that became a bigger hit, nor did he sing the theme to another show he is commonly associated with\u2014Champion the Wonder Horse (sung by Mike Stewart)\u2014but released his own, subsequently more popular version. Laine's enduring popularity was illustrated in June 2011, when a TV-advertised compilation called Hits reached No. 16 on the British chart. The accomplishment was achieved nearly 60 years after his debut on the UK chart, 64 years after his first major U.S. hit and four years after his death."@en .

One of the most popular and influential stars in the United States during her lifetime, she had one of Hollywood's longest careers, especially on television. Ball's film career spanned the 1930s and 1940s, and she became a television star during the 1950s. She continued making films in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1962, Ball became the first woman to run a major television studio, Desilu, which produced many successful and popular television series. Ball was nominated for an Emmy Award thirteen times, and won four times. In 1977, Ball was among the first recipients of the Women in Film Crystal Award. She was the recipient of the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1979, the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Kennedy Center Honors in 1986, and the Governors Award from the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences in 1989. In 1929, Ball landed work as a model and later began her performing career on Broadway using the stage name \"Diane Belmont\". She assumed many small movie roles in the 1930s as a contract player for RKO Radio Pictures. Ball was dubbed the \"Queen of the Bs\" (referring to her many roles in B-films). In 1951, Ball was instrumental in the creation of the television series I Love Lucy. The show co-starred her then-husband, Desi Arnaz, as Ricky Ricardo, Vivian Vance as Ethel Mertz, and William Frawley as Fred Mertz. The Mertzes were the Ricardos' landlords and friends. The show ended in 1957 after 180 episodes. The cast remained intact (with some additional cast members added) for a series of one-hour specials from 1957 to 1960 as part of The Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse. Its original network title was The Ford Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show for the first season, and The Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse Presents The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show for the following seasons. Later reruns were titled the more familiar Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour, which was a perennial summer favorite on CBS through 1967. The specials emphasized guest stars such as Ann Sothern, Rudy Vallee, Tallulah Bankhead, Fred MacMurray and June Haver, Betty Grable and Harry James, Fernando Lamas, Maurice Chevalier, Danny Thomas and his Make Room for Daddy co-stars, Red Skelton, Paul Douglas, Ida Lupino and Howard Duff, Milton Berle, Robert Cummings, and, in the final episode, \"Lucy Meets the Moustache\", Ernie Kovacs and Edie Adams. Ball went on to star in two more successful television series: The Lucy Show, which ran on CBS from 1962 to 1968 (156 Episodes), and Here's Lucy from 1968 to 1974 (144 episodes). Her last attempt at a television series was a 1986 show called Life with Lucy\u00A0\u2013 which failed after 8 episodes aired, although 13 were produced. Ball met and eloped with Cuban bandleader Desi Arnaz in 1940. On July 17, 1951, at almost 40 years old, Ball gave birth to their first child, Lucie D\u00E9sir\u00E9e Arnaz. A year and a half later, Ball gave birth to their second child, Desiderio Alberto Arnaz IV, known as Desi Arnaz, Jr. Ball and Arnaz divorced on May 4, 1960. On April 26, 1989, Ball died of a dissecting aortic aneurysm at age 77. At the time of her death, she had been married to her second husband and business partner, standup comedian Gary Morton, for more than 27 years. {{#invoke:Footnotes|sfn}}"@en .

She also performed as a pianist and organist. From a musical family, she achieved early honours as a student at the Paris Conservatoire but, believing that she had no particular talent as a composer, she gave up writing music and became a teacher. In that capacity, she influenced generations of young composers, especially those from the United States and other English-speaking countries. Among her students were those who became leading composers, soloists, and conductors, including Aaron Copland, John Eliot Gardiner, Dinu Lipatti, Igor Markevitch, Philip Glass, and \u00C1stor Piazzolla. Boulanger taught in the US and England, working with music academies including the Juilliard School, the Yehudi Menuhin School, the Longy School, the Royal College of Music and the Royal Academy of Music, but her principal base for most of her life was her family's flat in Paris, where she taught for most of the seven decades from the start of her career until her death at the age of 92. Boulanger was the first woman to conduct many major orchestras in America and Europe, including the BBC Symphony, Boston Symphony, Hall\u00E9, New York Philharmonic and Philadelphia orchestras.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jimi_Hendrix> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "James Marshall \"Jimi\" Hendrix (born Johnny Allen Hendrix; November 27, 1942 \u2013 September 18, 1970) was an American musician, singer and songwriter. Despite a limited mainstream exposure of four years, he is widely considered one of the most influential electric guitarists in the history of popular music, and one of the most important musicians of the 20th century. Inspired musically by American rock and roll and electric blues, following his initial success in Europe with the Jimi Hendrix Experience, he achieved fame in the US after his 1967 performance at the Monterey Pop Festival. Later, he headlined the Woodstock Festival in 1969 and the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970, before dying from drug-related asphyxia at the age of 27. Instrumental in developing the previously undesirable technique of guitar amplifier feedback, Hendrix favored overdriven amplifiers with high volume and gain. He helped to popularize the use of the wah-wah pedal in mainstream rock and he pioneered experimentation with stereophonic phasing effects in rock music recordings. The recipient of several music awards during his lifetime and posthumously, the Jimi Hendrix Experience was inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. Rolling Stone ranked his three non-posthumous studio albums, Are You Experienced, Axis: Bold as Love, and Electric Ladyland among the 100 greatest albums of all time. Rolling Stone also ranked him as the greatest guitarist of all time, and the sixth greatest artist of all time."@en .

From 1929 to 1931, he played with The Washboard Serenaders. He recorded with the Spirits of Rhythm from 1932 to 1937 and again from 1939 to 1941. Bunn recorded with such musicians as Sidney Bechet, Johnny Dodds, Jimmie Noone, J.C. Higginbotham and Lionel Hampton.

Gozzo (1922\u20131964) was an American trumpet player born in New Britain, Connecticut on February 6, 1922. Gozzo was a member of the NBC Hollywood staff orchestra at the time of his death on October 8, 1964. He died at the age of 42 of a heart attack. He played with Isham Jones (1938) and Red Norvo (1940), then performed and recorded with Bob Chester (1941) and Claude Thornhill (1941-2). After working with Benny Goodman (1942) he joined the navy and played in a band led by Artie Shaw (1942-4). He rejoined Goodman in 1945, then toured and recorded with Woody Herman (he was featured as a soloist on \"Stars fell on Alabama\", 1946 Col.37197and performed with Boyd Raeburn and Ted Beneke . In Los Angeles he played on Bob Crosby's radio broadcasts . Gozzo was highly acclaimed as a lead trumpeter and was much in demand as a studio musician; he also took part in sessions with Les Brown, Jerry Gray, Ray Antony, Billy May . Gozzo, lead trumpeter on the Glen Gray, Stan Kenton, and Harry James \"remakes\", and in Dan Terry's 1954 Columbia sessions, recorded extensively with arrangers Van Alexander, Nelson Riddle, Billy May, Ray Conniff, Jerry Fielding and Shorty Rogers, and also with performers Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra. Gozzo played first trumpet on all of the recordings of composer Henry Mancini. He routinely performed on many major live television shows which were broadcast on the NBC network, including the Dinah Shore Show . Gozzo also performed on motion picture soundtracks including The Glenn Miller Story, The Benny Goodman Story, Bye Bye Birdie, Call Me Madam, Ben-Hur and Cleopatra. He also performed on the Ella Fitzgerald two-record set on Verve . Gozzo's nicknames were \"Goz\" and \"Gopher\", due to his resemblance to a gopher when viewed from the front while he was playing. He was considered by his colleagues as being an exceptionally strong trumpeter with a well-developed range and tonal quality. He is credited by some as having shaped the lead trumpet concept of the swing era which is characterized by a large and robust tonality. For most of his recording career, he played a Besson Meha trumpet with a custom Bert Herrick mouthpiece. Occasionally, he played a Chicago Benge or a LeBlanc Gozzo model trumpet. \"Trumpeter's Prayer,\" was composed by Tutti Camarata for Gozzo, but Portrait of Trumpet by Sammy Nestico was written as a posthumous tribute."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bing_Crosby> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Harry Lillis \"Bing\" Crosby (May 3, 1903\u00A0\u2013 October 14, 1977) was an American singer and actor. Crosby's trademark bass-baritone voice made him one of the best-selling recording artists of the 20th century, with over half a billion records in circulation. A multimedia star, from 1934 to 1954 Bing Crosby was a leader in record sales, radio ratings and motion picture grosses. His early career coincided with technical recording innovations; this allowed him to develop a laid-back, intimate singing style that influenced many of the popular male singers who followed him, including Perry Como, Frank Sinatra, and Dean Martin. Yank magazine recognized Crosby as the person who had done the most for American G.I. morale during World War II and, during his peak years, around 1948, polls declared him the \"most admired man alive,\" ahead of Jackie Robinson and Pope Pius XII. Also in 1948, the Music Digest estimated that Crosby recordings filled more than half of the 80,000 weekly hours allocated to recorded radio music. Crosby exerted an important influence on the development of the postwar recording industry. He worked for NBC at the time and wanted to record his shows; however, most broadcast networks did not allow recording. This was primarily because the quality of recording at the time was not as good as live broadcast sound quality. While in Europe performing during the war, Crosby had witnessed tape recording, on which The Crosby Research Foundation would come to have many patents. The company also developed equipment and recording techniques such as the Laugh Track which are still in use today. In 1947, he invested $50,000 in the Ampex company, which built North America's first commercial reel-to-reel tape recorder. He left NBC to work for ABC because NBC was not interested in recording at the time. This proved beneficial because ABC accepted him and his new ideas. Crosby then became the first performer to pre-record his radio shows and master his commercial recordings onto magnetic tape. He gave one of the first Ampex Model 200 recorders to his friend, musician Les Paul, which led directly to Paul's invention of multitrack recording. Along with Frank Sinatra, Crosby was one of the principal backers behind the famous United Western Recorders recording studio complex in Los Angeles. During the \"Golden Age of Radio,\" performers often had to recreate their live shows a second time for the west coast time zone. Through the medium of recording, Crosby constructed his radio programs with the same directorial tools and craftsmanship (editing, retaking, rehearsal, time shifting) being used in motion picture production. This became the industry standard. Crosby won an Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as Father Chuck O'Malley in the 1944 motion picture Going My Way, and was nominated for his reprise of the role in The Bells of St. Mary's the next year, becoming the first of four actors to be nominated twice for playing the same character. In 1963, Crosby received the first Grammy Global Achievement Award. Crosby is one of the 22 people to have three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (a star for Motion Pictures, Radio, and Audio Recording)."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bill_Coleman> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "William Johnson Coleman (August 4, 1904 in Paris, Kentucky \u2013 August 24, 1981 in Toulouse) was a jazz trumpeter. In 1909 his family moved from Kentucky to Cincinnati. His first musical explorations were on clarinet and C melody saxophone, but he eventually settled on trumpet. As a young man he worked as a messenger for the Western Union telegraph company. He studied with Cincinnati trumpeter Theodore Carpenter, and played in an amateur band led by trombonist J.C. Higgenbotham. He began professional work in Cincinnati with bands led by Clarence Paige and Wesley Helvey (both bands his teacher Carpenter worked in) then with Lloyd and Cecil Scott. In December 1927 he traveled with the Scott brothers to New York City, and continued to work with them until the late summer of 1929, when he joined the orchestra of pianist Luis Russell. His first recording session was with Russell on September 6, 1929, and he solos on the tune \"Feelin' the Spirit. \" By December 1929 he had left Russell (partly due to the majority of the solo work going to section mate Henry \"Red\" Allen), but would rejoin the band on two more occasions during 1931-32. He rejoined the Scott brothers (then known as Cecil Scott's Bright Boys) in late 1929, participating in a Victor recording session, and continued to work with them through the early part of 1930. He worked with various New York based bands until rejoining Luis Russell in 1931. His first trip to Europe was with the band of Lucky Millinder from June until October 1933, after which he returned to New York to work with bandleaders Benny Carter and [(Teddy Hill)], whom he recorded with in early 1935. While with the Hill band he participated in a freelance recording session with pianist Fats Waller, waxing a number of memorable sides. Coleman returned to Cincinnati briefly in the summer of 1935, then headed to Europe, playing a residency in Paris with entertainer/vocalist Freddy Taylor (whom he had worked with in the Lucky Millinder band). While in Paris he recorded with guitarist Django Reinhardt and made several freelance sessions under his own name. In late 1936 he traveled to Bombay, India, playing with Leon Abbey's Orchestra, then back to Paris in April 1937, joining the band led by American-born saxophonist William T. Lewis (the band known as Willie Lewis and his Entertainers). After a sojourn to Cairo, Egypt, Coleman returned to the U.S. in March 1940, and worked throughout the 1940s with a variety of top groups including bands led by Benny Carter (1940), Teddy Wilson (1940-41), Andy Kirk (1941-42), Ellis Larkins (1943), Mary Lou Williams (1944), John Kirby (1945), Sy Oliver (1946-47), and Billy Kyle (1947-48). During this same time, Coleman participated in many recording sessions with top jazz stars such as Lester Young, Billie Holiday and Coleman Hawkins. He returned to France in 1948 and spent the rest of his life there in part due to racial segregation. Like many American musicians, he felt he received the recognition he deserved from European audiences, and during the decades he lived in France he traveled and performed in clubs and concert venues all over Europe. In 1978, he performed at the first Jazz in Marciac festival (along with tenor saxophonist Guy Lafitte), later becoming an honorary president of the festival organization. In 1974 he received the Ordre National du M\u00E9rite. From his first solo on record with the Luis Russell Orchestra, Coleman's playing exhibited a lighter sound more akin to Jabbo Smith than Louis Armstrong, yet his phrasing is more in the Armstrong vein than that of Smith. In many respects his playing was stylistically related to the playing by other swing era trumpeters such as Roy Eldridge and Buck Clayton."@en .

Born Nathan Robinson in Deer Range, a tiny settlement on the west bank of lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, where he studied music under James Brown Humphrey. He arrived in New Orleans looking for work shortly before the Great Hurricane of 1915 which wiped out his home town of Deer Range, which prompted Robinson to settle in the city. http://www. journalofamericanhistory. org/projects/katrina/Raeburn. html?link_id=whi_jazzfuneral He was playing professionally in his twenties, from World War I on. In the 1920s he made his first recordings as a member of the Sam Morgan Jazz Band. He achieved gained greater fame with the resurgence of interest in early New Orleans jazz starting in the 1940s as a regular member of the bands of Bunk Johnson and George Lewis. Occasionally, he also led his own band and appeared regularly at Preservation Hall in his later years. Robinson's widely recognized, individualistic sound was influential with many later traditional and New Orleans-style jazz trombonists in the United States and Europe. These included two prot\u00E9g\u00E9s whom Robinson tutored personally\u2014Frank Demond and Big Bill Bissonnette; Robinson's influence is more evident in the former. Big Jim's signature tune, \"Ice Cream\", was requested at almost all personal appearances after his virtuoso performance of the number in an American Music Records recording made in the 1940s. He also was known for promoting audience participation\u2014especially encouraging dancing whenever feasible. Jim Robinson died of cancer at the New Orleans Touro Infirmary. Although he usually indicated his date of birth as Christmas Day 1892, no specific parish records are known to substantiate the exact day and year. In his May 5, 1976 obituary in The New York Times, his age is given as 86 without citing a source, suggesting the year of birth to be 1889 or 1890."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christopher_Hitchens> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Christopher Eric Hitchens (13 April 1949\u00A0\u2013 15 December 2011) was a British-American author and journalist whose career spanned more than four decades. Hitchens, often referred to colloquially as \"Hitch\", contributed to New Statesman, The Nation, The Atlantic, The London Review of Books, The Times Literary Supplement, Slate Magazine, Free Inquiry and Vanity Fair. He was an author of twelve books and five collections of essays, and concentrated on a range of subjects, including politics, literature and religion. A prominent staple of talk shows and lecture circuits, his confrontational style of debate made him both a lauded and controversial figure. Known for his contrarian stance on a number of issues, he excoriated such public figures as Mother Teresa, Bill Clinton, Henry Kissinger, Lady Diana and Pope Benedict XVI. He was the older brother of author Peter Hitchens. Initially describing himself as a socialist, Hitchens began his break from the established political left after what he called the \"tepid reaction\" of the Western left to the Rushdie Affair. The September 11 attacks \"exhilarated\" him, strengthening his embrace of an interventionist foreign policy, and his criticism of what he called \"fascism with an Islamic face\". His numerous editorials in support of the Iraq War caused some to label him a neoconservative, although Hitchens insisted he was not \"a conservative of any kind\", and his friend Ian McEwan described him as representing the anti-totalitarian left. A noted critic of religion and a self-described antitheist, he said that a person \"could be an atheist and wish that belief in God were correct\", but that \"an antitheist, a term I'm trying to get into circulation, is someone who is relieved that there's no evidence for such an assertion. \" According to Hitchens, the concept of a God or a supreme being is a totalitarian belief that destroys individual freedom; and, that free expression and scientific discovery should replace religion as a means of teaching ethics and defining human civilization. His anti-religion polemic, God Is Not Great, sold over 500,000 copies. Hitchens died on 15 December 2011, from complications arising from oesophageal cancer, a disease that he acknowledged was likely due to his lifelong predilection for heavy smoking and drinking. His death prompted tributes and eulogies from a range of public figures, including Tony Blair, Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Lawrence Krauss, Martin Amis, James Fenton, Stephen Fry and Francis Collins."@en .

Oliver's drummer, Baby Dodds, made a particular and lasting impression upon Wettling. Wettling went on to work with the big bands of Artie Shaw, Bunny Berigan, Red Norvo, Paul Whiteman, and even Harpo Marx: but he was at his best on (and will be best remembered for) his work in small 'hot' bands led by Eddie Condon, Muggsy Spanier, and himself. In these small bands, Wettling was able to demonstrate the arts of dynamics and responding to a particular soloist that he had learned from Baby Dodds. Wettling was a member of some of Condon's classic line-ups, which included, among others, Wild Bill Davison, Billy Butterfield, Edmond Hall, Peanuts Hucko, Pee Wee Russell, Cutty Cutshall, Gene Schroeder, Ralph Sutton, and Walter Page, and in 1957 toured Britain with a Condon band including Davison, Cutshall, and Schroeder. Towards the end of his life, Wettling, took up painting, and was much influenced by the American cubist Stuart Davis. He has been quoted as remarking that \"jazz drumming and abstract painting seemed different from him only from the point of view of craftsmanship: in both fields he felt rhythm to be decisive\"."@en .

He and Louis Armstrong played in the same waif's home band, and when Armstrong joined the band on the S.S. Capitol, Rena was named his replacement in Kid Ory's band in 1919. He played with Ory until 1922, when Ory moved to Los Angeles; that year Rena formed his own band. This ensemble played all the New Orleans jazz houses regularly and played Chicago in 1923-24. He led the Eureka Brass Band in the late 1920s, remaining with them until 1932, when he formed his own brass band. Rena was hit hard by the Great Depression, and he eked out a living locally in New Orleans playing old-style jazz as it waned in popularity in favor of swing jazz. In 1940, Heywood Broun asked Kid Rena to record. Eight recordings were made in total, done at the Hotel Roosevelt and recorded by local radio station WWL on August 21, 1940. Rena's prowess as a live soloist was legendary, but by the time he recorded, he had lost much of his technical ability, and the recordings are of poor quality. Rena never recorded again; he was an alcoholic, and failing health led him to quit playing in 1947. He died two years later. Rena's 1940 sessions have been re-released on compact disc."@en .

He was known for swing and sweet dance music, as well as boogie woogie songs, many of which were written by Don Raye. Born in Newton, New Jersey, Schwictenberg was one of the premier trombonists on the New York swing scene, and he often participated in jam sessions broadcast on The CBS Saturday Night Swing Club. In 1939 he and drummer Ray McKinley formed a big band, with Schwictenberg taking the professional name of Will Bradley. The Bradley band became well known for boogie-woogie, particularly its hit record, \"Beat Me Daddy, Eight to the Bar\" with Freddie Slack on piano. This record, along with another big-band boogie woogie number, \"Scrub Me Mama with a Boogie Beat,\" and the original version of the classic, \"Down the Road a Piece\", were all three in the top 10 on the Billboard popular music charts at the same time, in late-1940. \"Down the Road a Piece\" was recorded with a pared-down trio called the \"Will Bradley Trio,\" made up of McKinley, Doc Goldberg, and Freddie Slack, with guest vocals by songwriter Don Raye. Will Bradley was one of the first bandleaders who appeared in Soundies, three-minute musical films made for coin-operated \"movie jukeboxes. \" Bradley's films, made in late 1940, were widely distributed and gave the Bradley band valuable exposure. Drummer Ray McKinley did most of the vocals. In 1942 McKinley left to form his own band and a few months after joined the United States Air Force, where he played in the Glenn Miller Air Force band. Bradley tried to maintain his band, but problems caused by the war forced Bradley to disband. Bradley became a studio musician, and played for many years in the The Tonight Show Band during the Johnny Carson era."@en .

In 1924 he played with Eugene Cook's Synco Six, and then took over leadership of the band, which played until 1934, playing mostly in the American South and Midwest, as well as on steamboats. He left music in the mid-1930s but returned with another band in 1938. His sidemen included Terrence Holder, Alex Hill, Stuff Smith, Snub Mosley, Charlie Christian, Sweets Edison, Mouse Randolph, and Peanuts Holland. As leader, he recorded only eight sides: four in 1928, two in 1930, and two in 1933. His small recorded legacy has made him a somewhat obscure figure today, but the sophistication of his arrangements and the precision with which they were executed inspired awe in contemporaries - one such, Budd Johnson stated: \"Let me tell you about Trent...

During Steinbrenner's 37-year ownership from 1973 to his death in July 2010, the longest in club history, the Yankees earned seven World Series titles and 11 pennants. His outspokenness and role in driving up player salaries made him one of the sport's most controversial figures. Steinbrenner was also involved in the Great Lakes shipping industry. Known as a hands-on baseball executive, he earned the nickname \"The Boss\". He had a tendency to meddle in daily on-field decisions, and to hire and fire (and sometimes re-hire) managers. Former Yankees manager Dallas Green gave him the derisive nickname \"Manager George\". He died after suffering a heart attack in his Tampa home on the morning of July 13, 2010, the day of the 81st All-Star Game."@en .

Dodds (pronounced \"dots\") was also the older brother of drummer Warren \"Baby\" Dodds. The pair worked together in the New Orleans Bootblacks in 1926. Born in Waveland, Mississippi, United States, he moved to new Orleans in his youth, and studied clarinet with Lorenzo Tio. He played with the bands of Frankie Duson, Kid Ory, and Joe \"King\" Oliver. Dodds went to Chicago and played with Oliver's Creole Jazz Band, with which he first recorded in 1923. Dodds also worked frequently with his good friend Natty Dominique during this period, a professional relationship that would last a lifetime. After the breakup of Oliver's band in 1924, Dodds replaced Alcide Nunez as the house clarinetist and bandleader of Kelly's Stables. He recorded with numerous small groups in Chicago, most notably Louis Armstrong's Hot 5 and Hot 7, and Jelly Roll Morton's Red Hot Peppers. Noted for his professionalism and virtuosity as a musician, and his heartfelt, heavily blues-laden style, Dodds was an important influence on later clarinetists, notably Benny Goodman. Dodds did not record for most of the 1930s, affected by ill health. He died of a heart attack in Chicago, in August 1940. In 1987, Dodds was inducted into the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame."@en .

To his admirers, he was a courageous advocate for the rights of blacks, a man who indicted white America in the harshest terms for its crimes against black Americans. Detractors accused him of preaching racism, black supremacy, and violence. He has been called one of the greatest and most influential African Americans in history. Malcolm\u00A0X's father died\u2014killed by white supremacists, it was rumored\u2014when he was young, and at least one of his uncles was lynched. When he was 13, his mother was placed in a mental hospital, and he was placed in a series of foster homes. In 1946, at age 20, he went to prison for breaking and entering. In prison, Malcolm\u00A0X became a member of the Nation of Islam; after his parole in 1952, he quickly rose to become one of its leaders. For a dozen years, Malcolm\u00A0X was the public face of the controversial group, but disillusionment with Nation of Islam head Elijah Muhammad led him to leave the Nation in March 1964. After a period of travel in Africa and the Middle East, he returned to the United States, where he founded Muslim Mosque, Inc. and the Organization of Afro-American Unity. In February 1965, less than a year after leaving the Nation of Islam, he was assassinated by three members of the group. Malcolm\u00A0X's expressed beliefs changed substantially over time. As a spokesman for the Nation of Islam he taught black supremacy and advocated separation of black and white Americans\u2014in contrast to the civil rights movement's emphasis on integration. After breaking with the Nation of Islam in 1964\u2014saying of his association with it, \"I did many things as a [Black Black] Muslim that I'm sorry for now. I was a zombie then ... pointed in a certain direction and told to march\"\u2014and becoming a Sunni Muslim, he disavowed racism and expressed willingness to work with civil rights leaders, he continued to emphasize Pan-Africanism, black self-determination, and self-defense."@en .

Avakian was born in Armavir, Russia, to Armenian parents. His younger brother was the photographer and filmmaker Aram Avakian (1926\u20131987). The elder Avakian attended Yale University, and became an avid collector and fan of jazz music. While still at Yale he was responsible for the first reissues Columbia put out around 1940, discovering some unissued Louis Armstrong masters from his Hot Five and Hot Seven period in the process. He later produced some of Armstrong's most important albums of the traditional jazz revival era, including Louis Armstrong Plays W. C. Handy. His annotations were noted for the education they provided to their listeners. To expand on this concept, in 1946, Avakian started a course in jazz history at Columbia University. His long tenure at Columbia Records culminated in his becoming responsible for the Popular Music and International divisions. During that time, Avakian introduced the LP record format created by Columbia engineers and produced the industry's first 100 long-playing discs of popular music and jazz. He also produced the first live LP\u2014Benny Goodman\u2019s 1938 Carnegie Hall concert. While at Columbia, Avakian signed and produced Dave Brubeck, Miles Davis, Louis Armstrong, Johnny Mathis, Rita Reys, and Erroll Garner to the label, among others. In 1959 he was hired as one of the founding A&R managers for the newly-established Warner Bros. Records and also worked as a producer for RCA Victor. In 1960-61 he produced recordings by Bill Haley & His Comets for Warner Bros. Records. Additionally, he signed Bob Newhart, producing the first comedy album to win a Best Album Grammy Award. In 1962 he was responsible for organizing Benny Goodman's successful tour of the USSR. From about 1970 to 1974, he was the manager of Keith Jarrett; before this, he managed the Charles Lloyd Quartet of which Jarrett was a member. After this, he largely retired from the record business and bred racehorses. Avakian bred champion pacer Presidential Ball. He is a founding officer of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (presenters of the Grammy Awards). His awards over the past years include: 2011\u00A0\u2013 Added to the ASCAP Jazz Wall of Fame as a Living Legend Giant of Jazz 2010\u00A0\u2013 National Endowments for the Arts AB Spellman Jazz Advocacy Award.

Avakian is married to violinist Anahid Ajemian, and the two, together with Ajemian's pianist sister Maro Ajemian, were crucial in helping classical composer Alan Hovhaness achieve his international breakthrough in the 1950s, through concert performances and through Avakian securing numerous LP recordings.

Barbour was born in Long Island, New York started off as a banjoist with Adrian Rollini in 1933 and then Wingy Manone in 1934. He switched to guitar in the middle of the decade and played with Red Norvo in 1935-1936. He found much work as a studio musician and played in ensembles with Artie Shaw (1939), Lennie Hayton, Charlie Barnet (1945), Raymond Scott, Glenn Miller, Lou Holden, and Woody Herman (1949). He also recorded with Andre Previn in 1945. He played with Benny Goodman in 1942, and while a member of Goodman's ensemble, he fell in love with lead singer Peggy Lee, and the pair quit the group to marry in 1943. Soon after they moved to Los Angeles, Johnny Mercer put them to work as a songwriting team, and they wrote a number of Lee's hits, such as \"Ma\u00F1ana (Is Soon Enough for Me)\" and \"It's a Good Day\". Barbour was an alcoholic and had domestic troubles with Lee; this eventually split apart their marriage, which ended in 1952. Dave Barbour and His Orchestra had the best-selling version (USA) of the peppy song \"Mambo Jambo. \" Barbour's remaining career was far less successful than Lee's (who would marry three more times). His songwriting royalties sustained him, as the tunes he co-wrote with Lee were covered by many hitmakers of the 1950s. He acted in the films The Secret Fury and Mr. Music, and occasionally performed, including with Benny Carter in 1962. He died in 1965 in Malibu Beach, California, aged 53. He is survived by his daughter by Peggy Lee, Nicki Lee Foster (born 1943)."@en .

Haggart was a founder-member of the Bob Crosby Band (1935), arranging and part-composing several of the band's big successes, including \"What's New?\", \"South Rampart Street Parade\", \"My Inspiration\", and \"Big Noise from Winnetka\". He remained with the band until 1942. He then worked as a studio musician in New York and recorded with Billie Holiday, Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman and Ella Fitzgerald; his arrangements can be heard on Ella's Decca release \"Lullabies of Birdland\". During the 1950s, Haggart organised, with Yank Lawson, a regular series of small band recordings and also arranged many of the tunes for Louis Armstrong's 1956-7 four-volume LP recreation set. Bob Crosby also used this ensemble as the core of many groups, including the band that recorded Haggart's arrangement of Porgy and Bess (1958). During the late 1960s he played frequently in bands organised by Bob Crosby. He co-led, with Yank Lawson, The World's Greatest Jazz Band (1968\u20131978). From 1978 until shortly before his death, Haggart worked with own groups or as a free-lance musician in several jazz groups and toured all over the world.

Bates lost a leg at the age of 12 in a cotton gin accident. He subsequently taught himself to tap dance with a wooden peg leg. His uncle, Wit, made his crude first \"peg leg\" after returning home from World War I and finding his nephew handicapped. Bates was a well-known dancer in his day. He performed on The Ed Sullivan Show approximately 58 times, and had two command performances before the King & Queen of England in 1936 and then again in 1938. He retired from the dancing business in 1996. He owned and operated the Peg Leg Bates Country Club in Kerhonkson, New York, from 1951 to 1987, along with his wife Alice E. Bates. This made Bates the first black resort owner in Ulster County in the Catskill Mountains, the famous Borscht Belt of Jewish resorts, hotels, and bungalow colonies. He was also very active in the local Ellenville Lions Club, and during the last ten years of his life he traveled regularly to schools, senior citizen centers, and nursing homes showing a video about his life and talking about his life experiences. He also helped found a local Senior Citizens Center in the Ellenville / Kerhonkson area. He loved to tell youngsters that they could do anything they wanted. He would say \"look at me. \" During a USO hospital tour, he partnered with vaudeville tap dancer Dixie Roberts, who said \"he danced better with one leg than anyone else could with two. \" Bates performed at an award ceremony at Hillcrest High School in his honor for receiving \"The Order of the Palmetto. \" the highest civilian awarded by the state in his hometown of Fountain Inn, South Carolina. He collapsed on his way to church a day later, and died on December 8, 1998, at age 91. The citizens of Fountain Inn erected a life-size statue that can be viewed in front of the city hall and Robert Quillen's library. There are signs at the entrance of the city saying \"Peg Leg Bates' home town. \" He was part of the first Louis Armstrong tour of Britain in the mid 50's PBS made a documentary of his life in the 1980s.

He earned a music degree from New York University, as a member of the Zeta Psi Fraternity. Marshall Brown was also a high school band director leading the Farmingdale New York 'Daler' Band from the early 1950s through 1957. Brown was the first high school band director to initiate a jazz education program, which he did in his tenure at Farmingdale High. By 1956 his stage band (jazz big band) the Daler Dance Band was so formidable and impressive (boasting future jazz stars Michael Abene on piano, Andrew Marsala, saxophone, and whiz drummer Larry Ramsden) that one night at the '56 Newport Jazz Festival, Count Basie, late for his appearance, as he entered the festival grounds heard the Daler Band performing their set and exclaimed, \"Damn, they started already\", mistaking the 'Dalers' for his band! The average age of the band members was 14! Brown received some attention for performing in a quartet with Pee Wee Russell in the early 1960s. While Russell was most often associated with Dixieland or swing music, their quartet performed more adventurous, free jazz-oriented pieces, including songs by Ornette Coleman and John Coltrane. Brown also performed or recorded with Ruby Braff and Beaver Harris and Lee Konitz."@en .

He performed with many famous jazz musicians, including Louis Armstrong, Sarah Vaughan, and Benny Goodman. Lesberg had the misfortune of playing in the Cocoanut Grove on the night in 1942 when 492 people lost their lives in a fire. His escape was memorialized by fellow bassist Charles Mingus in an unpublished section of Mingus's autobiography \"Beneath the Underdog\"; this passage was read by rapper Chuck D. on the Mingus tribute album \"Weird Nightmare\". According to Mingus's telling, Lesberg used his double bass to \"make a door\" inside the club which aided in his escape. Lesberg continued to tour in the 1980s and was interviewed for KCEA radio in 1984 following a performance in Menlo Park, CA. During the taped interview Jack spoke of the many bands and performers he worked with and expressed his feelings that he felt blessed to be a musician."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Matty_Matlock> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Julian Clifton \"Matty\" Matlock (April 27, 1907 \u2013 June 14, 1978) was an American Dixieland jazz clarinettist, saxophonist and arranger born in Paducah, Kentucky. From 1929 to 1934 Matlock replaced Benny Goodman in the Ben Pollack band doing arrangements and performing on clarinet. The following info on Matty is from the liner notes of his 1958 album The Dixieland Story: Matty Matlock was born in Paducah, Kentucky. Not unlike many famous musicians whose families had no musical tradition, Matty has a charming vignette from his very early years which, he believes, deeply influenced and pressed him inevitably toward a career in music. The scene took place when Matty was about to turn six. There is no evidence to the contrary, so it must be reported that the child Matty Matlock saw and heard (while the waters of a river flood receded slowly about him) an old Negro gentleman seated on a stoop playing a wistful melody on a tin flute. From that moment, Matty soberly claims, the twig was bent. Several years later, (the Matlocks had by then moved to Nashville) Matty recalls an incident which appears to have a more logical, if not so quaint, bearing on his musical career. Watching a National Guard outfit drilling (campaign hats and wrapped leggings) Matty noticed soldiers with rifles had to march briskly up and down across the streaming tarmac while, in the shade, the musicians sat leisurely blowing \"Too Much Mustard\". Sedentary occupations have a natural attraction to sensible folks in the catfish country. Shortly thereafter, Matty joined the Boy Scouts and made immediate application for the band. A Professor Simmons assigned the boys instruments by a process that might be called the \"bite\" system. Those with strong teeth and jutting jaws were assigned horns. A slightly receding chin qualified the applicant for the reeds. Anyone who would not fit readily into the Professor's dental categories was assigned to percussion. Matty made the reeds. In the Scouts Matty learned the Albert clarinet system, and later in the National Guard the Boehm System, all under the guidance of Professor Simmons. The delivery boy at the local drug store, Joycie, had a \"C\" Melody sax. Joycie could manage \"The Sheik\" on the instrument but not much else. During those periods when the neighbors demonstrated a strong resistance to Joycie's limited repertoire, Matty was able to borrow the saxophone, and with Professor Simmon's help, he learned to play it. Matty's father was a stonecutter, and itinerant journeyman who openly boasted he never paid a railroad fare in his life. This was a sizable accomplishment since Mr. Matlock, Sr. tired quickly of any one location. Her would be gone from home for years at a time. Until he was an adequately accomplished sideman, Matty held part time jobs selling hot tamales, delivering papers and sundries, and he was thirteen when he got his first \"gig\". He doubled clarinet and \"C\" melody at a hotel in Red Boiling Springs, a spa near Nashville, and significantly lasted only one night. Matty unfortunately could not be clearly seen behind the saxophone. the manager claimed he was entitled to five visible musicians; Matty was swapped for a bigger man. \"Casuals\" of all kinds: dances, socials, rallied, park concerts began to come in regularly. Matty was able to spend all his spare time with sic. He taught himself basic orchestration by writing down all the parts on Ted Lewis records. Banjo music at that time was noted on the clefs, symbols came later. Matty found he had ready made exams in analyzing banjo parts. In 1923 Matty began playing regularly with a five piece group, The Blue Melody Boys. He graduated to a slightly larger outfit, the Tennessee Ramblers which, Matty claims had the most impressive band picture ever taken. For the portrait the Ramblers we to O.K. Houck's Music Store and posed with the greatest number of instruments ever displayed with a band of its size. Matty alone was framed in a jungle of reeds: saxophones, oboes, clarinets, english horns. It was an impressive implication of doubling, tripling, and quadrupling. Possibly the Ramblers couldn't live up to their 8x10 glossies. They split, and Matty joined Beasley Smith at the Andrew Jackson Hotel (400 rooms \u2013 400 baths) in Nashville. It was 1925. Smith had a real \"jazz\" band, not a \"sissy\" band. Ray MacKinley came in from Texas with eight feet of drums and the biggest wad of active chewing gum Matty had ever seen. Beasley's boys openly boasted that it took Ray four hours to set up. Featuring MacKinley hammering out \"Heebie Jeebies\" on his tuned tom-toms Beasley Smith played the W.S. Butterfield Circuit as the staring attraction of a \"Syncopation Show\". In 1928 Matty married, moved to Tracey Brown's Orchestra, later joined Jimmie Joy and, after eight months returned to Beasley Smith. In New York meanwhile, Benny Goodman had decided to quit Ben Pollock. Word had gotten around that there was a boy with Beasley Smith who blew real good, and Pollock dispatched Jack Teagarden and Ray Bauduc to Pittsburgh to hear Matty. Teagarden staked himself out in a sample room of the Fort Pitt Hotel. Matty went to meet him. With six other musicians they sat passing a coronet around; everyone blew some, passed the born, talked and blew again - all night long. Teagarden and Baauduc returned to New York without ever hearing Matty on clarinet. Their official report to Pollock was terse. \"Guy's great. \" And Matty got Benny Goodman's chair with eh Pollock band. In 1934 Benn Pollock disbanded. Gil Rodin, Eddie Miller, Yank Lawson, Nappy Lamare, Ray Bauduc, Charlie Spivak, Gil Bowers and Matty left for New York to join Jack Teagarden. It was a move Teagarden had been carefully planning for some years. Unfortunately, though, Jack had no mind for details; he had overlooked the fact that he had a five year contract with Paul Whiteman. The stranded group decided to form a cooperative similar to Casa Loma and the Rockwell-O'Keefe Agency suggested one of three personalities to front the new band: Goldie Goldmark, Johnny \"Scat\" Davis and Bob Crosby. The boys picked Crosby. Bob Haggard, bass, joined the group early. Along with the original members he became a participating member of the cooperative, with Gil Rodin acting as manager. Gil Bowers quite; Joe Sullivan and later Bob Zurke became identified as pianists with the band. For eight years Bob Crosby and Bobcats, consistently loyal to a unique, free swinging style, remained among the top few musical organizations along with such attractions as Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw and the Dorseys. Matty and Bob Haggart, through the years, mad the major contributions to the unique \"book\" which came to characterize the Crosby band. Matty arranged \"Boogie Woogie Maxixe\", \"Little Rock Getaway\", \"Honky Tonk Train\", \"Dixieland Shuffle\", \"Tea for Two\" among many others. By 1942 most of the original Crosby sidemen were sitting in with the armed services. With gas rationing and travel priorities, moving a band around the country was almost impossible and the cooperative was dissolved. Matty came to California where he's been ever since: playing and arranging for Paul Weston, John Scott Trotter, Phil Harris, Johnny Mercer, Connie Haines, Peggy Lee, The Lancers, Frank Sinatra, and Bob Crosby. He arranged for and helped Jack Webb organize the \"Pete Kelly\" group. Matty lives quietly with his family in San Fernando Valley. He still holds the young enthusiasm for ajar that he had when climbed behind the \"C\" Melody sax on the bandstand at Red Boiling Springs. A consistent, almost obsessive belief in craftsmanship, tone and technique, qualify Matty's work on clarinet. His arrangements bear the impairing of a sentence he and Bob Haggard always employed to criticize each other's work, \"Phrase it stingy \u2013 like Louie!\""@en .
